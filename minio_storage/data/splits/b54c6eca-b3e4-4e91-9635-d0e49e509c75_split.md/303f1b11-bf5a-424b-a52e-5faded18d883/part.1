How to be a graphic designer in the middle of nowhere An introduction Opposite My first mass-produced piece of graphic design was a poster for our high school production of Wait Until Dark, a tense drama about a blind woman threatened by a criminal gang (hence the eyes).

11 As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a graphic designer. I must have been no more than five or six years old. I was in the car with my father on a Saturday on my way to get a haircut. We were stopped at a light, and my dad pointed at a forklift truck parked in a nearby lot. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that neat?‚Äù he asked. What, I said. ‚ÄúLook at the way they wrote ‚ÄòClark.‚Äô‚Äù Clark was the logo on

the side of the truck. I didn‚Äôt get it. ‚ÄúSee how the letter L is lifting up the letter A?‚Äù explained my father. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs doing what the truck does.‚Äù It was as if an amazing secret had been revealed, right there in plain sight. I was dumbfounded and thrilled. How long had this been going on? Were these small miracles hidden all over the place? And who was responsible for creating them? I was in the

first grade at St. Theresa‚Äôs School in Garfield Heights, Ohio, when my teachers first noticed that I was good at drawing. This was no small thing. I was a good student, but among my peers in 1960s suburban Cleveland, academic diligence was viewed with suspicion, if not outright contempt. Artistic ability, on the other hand, was like a kind of magic. Inept at sports and generally withdrawn, I

suddenly had a way to distinguish myself in the schoolyard. The nuns called it a ‚ÄúGod-given talent,‚Äù and I milked it for all it was worth. Luckily, I received nothing but encouragement from my parents. They bought me a succession of ever-more esoteric implements (charcoal sticks! pastels! kneaded erasers!) and signed me up for Saturday morning art classes at one of the world‚Äôs great cultural

Art was something I used to make friends (and, occa- sionally, to keep from getting beaten up). At the request of one of the school‚Äôs more frightening bullies, I painstakingly replicated the Budweiser logo on the cover of

A turning point came in the ninth grade when I was asked to do a poster for the school play. I handed in the artwork on a Friday morning, it was printed that afternoon, and by Monday morning my poster was hanging all over the school. This was my first experience with the miracle of mass production. More people would see my poster than would see the play. I realized then I didn‚Äôt want to settle

for just doing a single painting to be stuck on the wall at someplace like the Cleveland Museum of Art. I wanted to create things with a purpose, things that people would see all over the place, things that were about something other than themselves. It was hard to explain. I had no idea how posters and logos came into the world. I didn‚Äôt know any working artists, and didn‚Äôt know anyone else to

ask. If pressed, I would have guessed that things like album covers were designed by real artists like Franz Kline and Robert Rauschenberg who had decided to take a day off and make some extra money. One day, I was in our school library, idly browsing the Career Resource Center. This was a grandiose name for what was no more than a shelf bearing a matched set of books called the Aim High

Here were page after page of men and women who were doing what I wanted to do, with

Looking back, I am utterly mystified that this obscure book, a dry account of the coursework at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Basel, Switzerland, ended up on the shelves of a small suburban library in Parma, Ohio.

designer in person, I knew what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. Somehow, my high school guidance counselor found just the right college for me at the opposite end of the state, where the University of Cincinnati‚Äôs College of Design, Architecture, and Art offered a five-year program in graphic design. There I was plunged into a milieu that owed more to the minimalism of the Swiss

Submitting myself to a boot camp‚Äôs worth of punishing visual exercises, I unlearned my bad habits and replaced them with the basics of design, typography, color, and layout. Imagination and energy may be innate traits, but precision and craftsmanship are skills that can only be mastered through hard practice. Our professors

were determined that no one graduate without them. It was telling that the degree I received was a bachelor of science, for in Cincinnati I mastered a kind of design that was as logical, self contained, and elegant as the laws of physics. It was later in New York that I would discover the power of passion. 13 01/06/2015 12:54 Today, everyone knows Hofmann and Glaser, but Fujita is an unsung hero:

worked for Massimo and Lella Vignelli for ten years. They were my surrogate parents, and their studio was my adoptive family. In retrospect, it wasn‚Äôt a surprise that Massimo Vignelli loved my portfolio: sans serif typefaces on every page, modular grids underpinning every layout. After all, this was the acclaimed designer who had introduced Helvetica to the United States, created a relentlessly

With his wife, Lella, Massimo ran a Manhattan office from which issued a mind-boggling stream of logos, posters, books, interiors, and products. In the summer of 1980, I married my high school sweetheart, Dorothy, and moved to New York to

But I also knew that my new boss had a strong point of view, and that his designers worked within clearly prescribed aesthetic limits. My plan was to spend 18 months there and move on. I ended up staying ten years. Despite the firm‚Äôs reputation for modernist austerity, Lella and

Massimo presided over a workplace of extraordinary warmth, filled with noise and laughter and varied, exciting projects. Design there was a sacred calling, and in joining the profession you were committing to a fight against stupidity and ugliness. The clients who came to us were enlisting in the same battle. It helped that I was a good, even compulsive, mimic. Having learned my earliest lessons

about graphic design by copying from library books, I found it impossible not to imitate Massimo‚Äôs unmistakable style. He came to trust me, and continued to encourage me even when my ideas began to diverge from his. After ten years, I was managing the firm‚Äôs graphic design operations. But more and more I wondered: what kind of work would I do if I were on my own? The answer came in the form of a

dinner invitation from a colleague, Woody Pirtle. Woody was a partner in the New York office of a firm called Pentagram, legendary for its unique structure. Its partners worked in a hierarchy-free collective, each managing a small design team, each sharing the resources of an international organization. 14 An introduction 00882_Bierut_CS5.5_PENTAGRAM_02.indd 14 30/04/2015 14:0

A casual conversation about my future turned into something else. Over coffee, he asked if I might be interested in becoming Pentagram‚Äôs newest partner. His timing was perfect. I loved the bustle of a big office. The loneliness of a sole proprietorship held little appeal. Combining autonomy and community, Pentagram offered the best of both worlds.

Dorothy, and said yes. In the fall of 1990, I started my second job. My second job may be my last job. I‚Äôve been at Pentagram for nearly 25 years. And, to a remarkable extent, I am doing exactly what I always wanted to do. I still recall the seismic jolt of seeing that forklift truck logo, or opening that book in my school library. What I couldn‚Äôt figure out then was how people came to make these

kinds of things. Where did the ideas come from? What happened between an idea and its realization? How could you tell if the ideas worked? How were people talked into accepting them? Was it magic? Or was there a limit to what graphic design could do? And, finally, how could I get to do it, too? Since my first poster in the ninth grade, I‚Äôve discovered that my questions have many possible answers.

How to think with your hands Four decades of notebooks Opposite and above For more than 30 years, I‚Äôve seldom gone anywhere without a composition book. As a result, they take a beating. On August 12, 1982, I opened up a standard 7¬Ω&#34; by 9¬æ&#34; composition book and began taking notes on a phone conversation. I forget where the book came from. I may have found it in the supply cabinet of

Vignelli Associates, where I had been working for a little over two years. This was the beginning of a habit‚Äîor a compulsion‚Äîthat has continued to this day. I cannot walk into a meeting or start a phone call without my notebook. Other designers have amazing sketchbooks. Not me. A few pages look like they belong to a real designer: drawings, type studies, visual ideas being worked out. But most

are filled with to-do lists, phone calls to be returned, budget calculations, meeting notes. In college, I discovered that writing down something helped me remember it later. Paradoxically, that means that a lot of these notes, taken once, are never referred to again. Although I am (or I used to be) a good draughtsman, drawing may no longer be a relevant skill in the digital world. (Knowing how

to read is more important than knowing how to draw.) But looking back through the years, I‚Äôm surprised by the occasional visual notes in these books, and how often they anticipated the design work to come. Often, in the midst of a dense list of bullet points, there will sit a quick diagram, an embryonic sketch that represented the first step of what would be months of work. When the idea of a

preferred candidate. But this year, there were too many candidates to fit in a single column. So LePore came up with a new layout. She alternated the names on either side of the holes, first on the left, second on the right, third on the left, and so on. This turned out to be a problem on election day. The first name on the left side of the ballot was George W. Bush. If you wanted to vote for

to help this librarian and the dozens like her to do their jobs better. In a way, this is the only purpose my work has ever had. For design can‚Äôt save the world. Only people can do that. But design can give us the inspiration, the tools, and the means to try. We left determined to keep trying. 307 30/04/2015 14:0

The Robin Hood Foundation is New York‚Äôs most remarkable charity. True to its name, it takes money donated by the city‚Äôs wealthiest citizens and uses 100 percent of those funds to help the city‚Äôs poorest. Robin Hood‚Äôs genius is finding ways to magnify the impact of those dollars, often using design as a tool. The Library Initiative, which rallied dozens of publishers, builders, and architects, is

As the project‚Äôs graphic design directors, we asked the best illustrators and designers in New York to join us in transforming the one room in a public school where students are most likely to learn in a group environment: the library.

Acknowledgments This book is dedicated to the memory of two extraordinary men: Massimo Vignelli and William Drenttel. From Massimo, I learned how to be a designer. From Bill, I learned that there were no limits to what a designer could contribute to the world. I strive to reach the standards they set. Long before I knew what a graphic designer was, my parents, Leonard and Anne Marie Bierut,

encouraged me to be an artist. My parents and my wonderful brothers, Ronald and Donald, must have found me baffling, but they usually managed to conceal it. They were the best thing about growing up in suburban Cleveland. In junior high school, in high school, and in college, I had remarkable, dedicated teachers like Sue Ann Neroni, John Kocsis, Gordon Salchow, Joe Bottoni, Anne Ghory-Goodman,
