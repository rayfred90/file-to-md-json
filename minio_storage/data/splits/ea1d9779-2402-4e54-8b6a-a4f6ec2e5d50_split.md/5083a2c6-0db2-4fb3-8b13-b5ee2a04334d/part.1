Hello, Friend!
Since launching our first eBook back in February 2022, we‚Äôve seen an
outpouring of love, amazing reviews, awesome success stories, but also
countless requests for more design-related content.

---

## Chunk 5

We listened to your feedback and launched two more books, ‚ÄúThe Design
Manual‚Äù for those wanting to master mobile design, and the ‚ÄúUltimate
Guide to Web Design‚Äù for those interested in exploring the world of
profitable freelance and web design. Things were going great!
As we gained more experience in the art of writing, we quickly realized

---

## Chunk 6

that the content of our free eBook began to feel rushed, and the quality
wasn‚Äôt up to the standards of our other products. We've decided to pull
down our first eBook and give it a complete overhaul. To maintain high
quality and make the content of our new ebook ever-evolving, we also
decided to price it at $9. I want you to know that we truly listened and have
(hopefully!) made it much better.

---

## Chunk 7

So, here it is, a completely new, re-imagined version of our first eBook ‚Äî
"How to design better UI 3.0‚Äù.

Setting up Figma for mobile vs web
Jumping into design, especially with tools like Figma, you'll quickly realize
that mobile and web design have their distinct characteristics. Both
require a different, unique approach to master, but once you grasp the
fundamentals, designing for both is equally fun and rewarding.

---

## Chunk 18

Let‚Äôs cover some basics first.
Available canvas
As you can see in the image below, there are some major differences
when designing for desktop vs designing for mobile. The main difference
lies in the available space and the axis orientation of the content itself. On
desktop, content stacks horizontally in columns and rows, columns

Choosing the right frame
When you‚Äôre designing for mobile devices, pick a frame size that matches
the smallest and most common devices, like the iPhone 13 Mini or
Android Small/Large.

---

## Chunk 21

This helps make sure your design looks good for most mobile users.
If your interface elements have enough space to fit on the smallest frame,
you‚Äôre good to go. The opposite would be starting to work on one of the
larger screen resolutions only to find out your interface won‚Äôt scale down
appropriately, leaving you, or worse, your developers, with a lot of

responsiveness issues to solve in the post-design phase.

Remember that it‚Äôs always easier to scale your designs up than down.

---

## Chunk 23

--- Page 9 ---
1200x1024 1440x1024 1920x1024
For web, start with a 1440x1024 frame, or if you plan to no-code your web
designs in Framer, go for 1200x1024. Typically, a 1440x1024 frame is a safe
starting point, but also keep in mind larger displays, such as 1920x1024,
mainly to visualize the changes in scale. The key here is to create designs
for the main desktop breakpoints.

---

## Chunk 24

With no-code tools like Framer and Webflow, if you choose a 1440px frame
as your base width, you‚Äôll find that as soon as your frame hits 1439px in
size, Framer will automatically jump to the next breakpoint in line, which in
our case will be Tablet. It‚Äôs not ideal.

---

## Chunk 25

How to fix this? Just make sure that when you start designing on a 1440px
frame in Figma, leave enough margin to create a working space of 1200px
(with 20-40px margins) and place your designs inside.

We‚Äôll cover that in the next chapter.

Layouts
& Grids

## Chunk 26

Intro to grid systems
Before diving further, it's important to note: what I'm about to share is my
unique method for designing websites and mobile interfaces in Figma,
Framer, and Webflow, one that has consistently delivered results for me.
While other designers might have their own preferences, the key here is

---

## Chunk 27

producing designs that are clear and well-structured. When designs meet
these criteria, developers can translate them into reality more efficiently,
reducing the need for extensive back-and-forth communication.

---

## Chunk 28

This approach has not only benefited me but also the developers I've
collaborated with so rest assured that the things you‚Äôll learn have been
tried and tested by myself. Now, let‚Äôs cover some basics first!

---

## Chunk 29

--- Page 12 ---
The basic terms
Minimalist Settings Page from the zave.it app
Column grid - a layout framework that divides a webpage or app screen
into vertical columns, helping us align and organize elements
consistently. It assists in maintaining consistent alignment and
organization of all the design elements within a certain frame.

---

## Chunk 30

Baseline grid - a set of horizontal lines that define a consistent spacing
sequence in a set frame. In UI design, it's used to create the vertical
rhythm and help with the text alignment. It‚Äôs not as common but you
might find its use when designing icons, logos, or more complex
dashboard layouts for mobile and desktop devices.

---

## Chunk 31

--- Page 13 ---
Columns - refer to the vertical sections within a column grid. In UI design,
they provide a guide for aligning elements and text. Figma provides
enough flexibility to specify the number of columns within a grid and/or
define the width of columns in a layout
Side Margin - the space on the left and right sides of a grid or layout. In UI

---

## Chunk 32

design, they provide breathing room and frame the content. In Figma,
setting consistent side margins helps in creating balance and prevents
the main content from being spread across the entire device width.
Gutter - space between columns in a column grid. It helps provide a
guide to separate the content for better readability.

---

## Chunk 33

--- Page 14 ---
The 8-pt grid
The 8-point grid system ensures that everything in the interface lines up
neatly and consistently. What this system means in practice, is it follows
multiples of 8 for all the spacing, margin, and even dimensions of user
interface components.

---

## Chunk 34

This approach is not only great for creating consistent designs but also
aligns with the pixel density of most screens, so you‚Äôre pretty much sure
that your designs will scale well across different devices.
For added versatility, especially when dealing with smaller elements or
finer details, I might occasionally use a 4-point grid instead. This provides

---

## Chunk 35

more precise control, especially in mobile app design.

---

## Chunk 36

Sometimes, and that‚Äôs only when working with Bootstrap grids, I might
use a 5px grid for some website designs that won‚Äôt be coded by myself.
8px 16px 24px 32px 40px 48px 56px 64px
An 8-pt grid breakdown from the Design Manual

---

## Chunk 37

--- Page 15 ---
8px vs 5 px grids
A 5px grid is often a better choice when working with a Bootstrap grid
that has a fixed column layout and requires more compact spacing. On
the other hand, 8px grids are well-suited for fluid layouts that benefit from
a bit more spacing and visual breathing room.
What‚Äôs the right setup for an 8px grid?

---

## Chunk 38

This choice mainly depends on your preference, but from my experience,
I've found a Fluid Grid with 12 columns, 100px margins, and 20px gutters to
be the perfect starting point for all my website designs.
If you go with these settings, your total width will be 1240px. This will let
you divide it into 3 columns, each 400px wide, with 20px gutters between

---

## Chunk 39

the columns, or 4 columns, each 295px wide with 20px gutters.

---

## Chunk 40

More details on the next page.

--- Page 16 ---
The Desktop Grid
My standard grid for a website design is built on a 1440x1024px frame.
It might seem complex at first, but my approach is straightforward: I opt
for 100px margins all around. This creates a 1240px safe zone for my
designs, which I can then adapt for web use. My layout includes a 12-
column grid, separated by 20px gutters.

---

## Chunk 41

If I develop my designs in Framer, I add 20px of additional side margin to
let my designs breathe when they hit the breakpoint‚Äôs edge.

I design for two box widths - a minimum of 1200px and maximum of 1920px+

---

## Chunk 42

--- Page 17 ---
Containers
This is important especially for development. When designing your pages,
consider how your content will be coded. The best approach is to envision
each section and element as being placed inside containers, or blocks, or
what we refer to as divs or boxes in web development. This practice of
nesting boxes within boxes is known as "The Box Model."

---

## Chunk 43

So, imagine everything sitting in containers. Don‚Äôt go too crazy with your
layout because developers will hate you for your ‚Äúcreativity‚Äù.
My Figma Mastery course breaks down the box model in more detail
Whenever you add a new element, you need to think about its bounding
box and the position within the existing layout. So, put your images into

---

## Chunk 44

containers and your containers into bigger containers until they become
columns and sections. And don‚Äôt forget about padding and margins.

---

## Chunk 45

--- Page 18 ---
Scaling up past 1440px
When designing for small screens, it's important to consider what
happens when we exceed a 1920x1080 resolution. This practice is often
overlooked by beginner designers. How will our design stay responsive?

You want to cover as many screen sizes as possible so starting with a
smaller one will help you cover more choices.

---

## Chunk 48

Depending on your design, the same box-width on higher resolution
might look like an overkill leaving too much space for side margins and
making the entire design look unbalanced, especially when we‚Äôre moving
closer to 4k screen resolutions or the ultra-wide monitors.

---

## Chunk 49

--- Page 19 ---
This is how our design would look like on 2k resolution. It‚Äôs not bad, but
what can we do to make it better? Let‚Äôs see:
One way a developer can translate your designs into fully responsive, live
websites is by using responsive parameters like VW (viewport width) or
EMs, which are units relative to the font size of the base element. In most

---

## Chunk 50

cases that‚Äôs 16px. Sounds confusing, I know, but bear with me, I‚Äôll try to
cover this in one of future updates!

---

## Chunk 51

If you decide to no-code your designs, in most tools there‚Äôs a setting
called max width. When going over 1920x1080p we can choose to set the
maximum width as our boundary. This width setting is entirely up to you.
Let‚Äôs say we want to stop scaling our designs at 1920 px. We can always
design a screen for our developers (or ourselves) to visualize this better.

---

## Chunk 52

--- Page 20 ---
Fixed vs full width
You can either set percentage values for your side margins (5-10%) and
let your designs span across 80-90% of the available space, or place the
design on a fixed width, like the 1240px we mentioned in the last slide.
This will highly depend on your personal preference.
If you set a fixed width for your designs you need to keep in mind the

---

## Chunk 53

smallest resolution breakpoint. If your landing page has a 1240px layout
and someone visits it from a smaller device (or via split screen) you need
to add side padding to add some breathing room to your layout.

---

## Chunk 54

--- Page 21 ---
Mobile Grid
With smaller screens, mobile designs are often more focused, prioritizing
essential content and ensuring usability within limited space.
Every pixel counts.
The canvas here is compact, and often designers have to make choices
about what to include and what to keep for larger screens.

---

## Chunk 55

I always start designing mobile views on the latest iPhone frame with the
smallest size (375px wide) as it‚Äôs much easier to scale the design up.
I use a minimum of 16px margins on the side with 8px gutters and build
my interface on a 4-column grid. For Android, I start with Android Small
and use the same grid layout as for the iOS.

---

## Chunk 56

--- Page 22 ---
Row grid
Row grids provide a framework for more structured layout, helping you
align and space your components uniformly, therefore enhancing the
visual appeal and readability of the interface. Not as popular as column
grids, they do have their purpose in interface design; they are especially
useful for designing complex web and mobile dashboard views.

While row grids are invaluable for designers in maintaining visual
consistency, it's essential to understand that developers might not utilize
them directly. This is because, in the world of front end development (or

---

## Chunk 58

software development), there aren't explicit 'row grids'.

---

## Chunk 59

Instead, developers rely on frameworks, CSS grids, and Flexbox to
achieve similar layout objectives.

---

## Chunk 60

--- Page 23 ---
Soft vs hard grid
Whether you should or shouldn‚Äôt use a hard grid is really up to you.
I rarely use baseline grids to space out my elements vertically. As a rule of
thumb, I add my vertical columns and make sure that all the elements fit
in the horizontal container and distances between them, as well, as
elements themselves, are built on 4-8px increments.

---

## Chunk 61

When/if you‚Äôre more experienced, you‚Äôll find yourself designing without
any layout grids at all, using 4-8px spacing increments and auto-layout as
your only source of truth. That‚Äôs how I usually design most of my
interfaces. I‚Äôve done it so many times, that it‚Äôs enough for me to just turn
the grids on for quick reference whenever I need to align something that

---

## Chunk 62

has a more difficult placement within the design, and then continue
designing with my grids turned off.

Container alignment
When aligning your ‚Äúinner‚Äù containers you should aim to fit in the given
widths of the columns using the gutter widths as your margins. It will
make it much easier to design with your elements aligned within the grids.
Design Manual website was built on a 12-column layout with an 8px grid
It‚Äôs worth mentioning that you shouldn‚Äôt worry about the alignment of

---

## Chunk 65

your elements within the container itself. Just make sure you use round
numbers to space them out and give your container elements enough
room to breathe by adding between 20-40px of inner padding if needed.

---

## Chunk 66

You should use padding depending on the visual context. In the image
above, I added gutters (margins) between the columns of a single row to
fit the design inside my box width and align it with my header navigation
width to anchor the content to the both edges for easier scanning.

---

## Chunk 67

--- Page 26 ---
Importance of the vertical rhytm
Vertical rythm establishes consistent vertical spacing, ensuring that text,
headings, and other design elements are uniformly spaced and aligned.
Space your elements according to their proximity. Titles and descriptions
can be spaced at 8-20px+; text groups and icons/buttons - 20-40px+.
Add 12-20px+ padding around containers for better legibility.

---

## Chunk 68

Horizontal Alignment
If your design contains a set of components that‚Äôs similar, align them
appropriately. Imagine them being nested in container boxes with their
heights at a fixed value, and place them on the same horizontal line.

Layout consistency
Consistency in design means making things look and work the same way
throughout. It helps users know what to expect, making things easier to
use. When everything feels familiar, users trust the design more. In short,
consistency makes things clear and user-friendly.

---

## Chunk 71

Besides all that, a clear grid layout provides you and your team with a set
of consistent sizes, spacing values, and patterns for your projects. This is
extremely important when you want to build a product that will last, be
constantly updated, often by different team members.

---

## Chunk 72

A lot of designers will tell you to screw naming layers, freestyle a design
process, or forget auto-layout and this will work as long as you‚Äôre working
solo or with an inexperienced design/dev team on your client‚Äôs side. But
as soon as you join a proper team, you‚Äôll need to follow certain guidelines.
The sooner you learn them, the better. You can always simply choose not

--- Page 28 ---
Mind the (white) space
White space, often referred to as negative space, is the unmarked area
between design elements. It prevents visual clutter, improves readability,
and creates a focus point. You should use it to create better visual
hierarchy, guiding the user's eye from one element to another seamlessly,
without second-guessing the importance.

---

## Chunk 75

This goes for both inner padding and the outer margin. Remember to
leave at least 16-20px of margin and make your interactive elements easier
to tap. Space them apart to avoid miss-clicks. Let your content breathe.

---

## Chunk 76

--- Page 29 ---
Less is more - don‚Äôt overcomplicate your UI
When designing your interfaces you should always think about what else
can you strip from your layout without compromising the functionality
and aesthetics, rather than constantly adding more elements. Everything
you add increases cognitive load ‚Äì the amount of processing power it

## Chunk 77

takes for your brain to process what‚Äôs happening on the screen. The more
elements you add, the harder it is to understand your layout.

Colors in UI
howtodesignbetter designme @uiadrian

--- Page 31 ---
Basics of Colors in UI
Colors are used to accentuate important UI elements, set the tone, and
most subconsciously drive user behavior. In UI design, colors serve not
only as the eye-candy decoration but also as functional guides,
influencing user attention and improving usability and legibility.

---

## Chunk 80

Proper use of colors can improve user engagement, drive conversions,
and convey brand identity much more effectively. Because of this, every
designer must have a really good grasp of color theory.
Especially important is the knowledge of designing for the minimum
accessibility recommendations where compliance with the minimum
values is the ultimate requirement for most commercial projects.

Purple brings emotions of luxury and creativity, appealing to brands that
aim for innovation; however, its charm has been lost and diminished with

## Chunk 91

Going into a less colorful spectrum, black offers elegance, favored by
high-end products for its modern aesthetics. It‚Äôs also effectively used in
dark mode designs to enhance visibility and minimize eye strain.
And lastly, white symbolizing purity and simplicity, creates a clutter-free
space that focuses attention on critical elements and embraces the

---

## Chunk 92

principles of minimalism. Synergies well with black and any accent color.

---

## Chunk 93

It‚Äôs also important to understand that colors can have different meanings
in different cultures, affecting user engagement and the overall success
of an application on a global scale. Always research what colors mean in
the market you're designing for to make sure your product does well.

Tints and shades
Primary, secondary, and tertiary colors come in various tints and shades
beyond their pure forms. Tints are made by mixing pure colors with white,
leading to pastel shades that are less saturated. Shades are formed by
adding black to pure colors.

Warm vs cool colors
In UI design, it's all about setting the right mood. Warm colors with hues
ranging from red to yellow make everything feel more inviting and comfy.

Contrast and legibility
Maintaining readability of text against its background color should be your
main concern when designing your interfaces.
The right contrast not only ensures that text is easily legible but also
serves to emphasize calls to action, distinguish different elements, and
draw attention to important information.

Design in grayscale
Grayscale design is an efficient and focused approach to creating user

Shadows

## Chunk 129

Intro to shadows
In UI design, using shadows helps make digital spaces feel more like the
real world by adding depth and realism to the visuals. By mimicking the
way light interacts with objects in the real world‚Äîwhere items can
overlap, cast shadows, and reflect light‚Äîdesigners can infuse a sense of
depth and realism into digital spaces. Using shadows in UI is not only

---

## Chunk 130

about about aesthetics; but first and foremost, about enhancing usability.

---

## Chunk 131

Skillfully integrated shadows help differentiate layers, establish visual
hierarchy, and guide users through their interactions with the interface.
As we delve into the use of shadows in UI, we'll explore how this element,
rooted in our everyday experiences, becomes an important component in
creating engaging, intuitive, and visually compelling interfaces.

---

## Chunk 132

Many beginner designers struggle with creating natural-looking shadows,
so in this chapter we‚Äôll dive deep into the art of crafting effective and
visually appealing shadow effects in Figma.

---

## Chunk 133

--- Page 48 ---
Elevation
How do we make shadows appear natural and aesthetically pleasing? Use
elevation to add a layer of depth, simulating how objects cast shadows
based on their distance from other surfaces. Look at the example below:

directions. Making your shadow softer will make them look more natural,
similar to the real-world environment where the light source is far above
the object. This increased elevation adds more depth and more impact.

## Chunk 147

Shadows on dark backgrounds?
On a dark background, where your shadows might not be visible, a well-
placed lighter highlight can serve a similar purpose. This technique can
draw attention to specific elements, such as buttons or cards, adding to
the interactivity and creating a sense of elevation similar to regular
shadows on lighter backgrounds.

---

## Chunk 148

If you insist on adding ‚Äúreal‚Äù shadows in dark mode, you can do that by
layering multiple higher opacity shadows below your interface element.

Similarly, use Beautiful Shadows plugin to make it easier for yourself. Just
remember to slide that opacity setting all the way up, or close to 100 for a

## Chunk 150

--- Page 55 ---
Intro to gradients
Gradients have become a dynamic tool in ours arsenal, offering yet
another way to add depth, dimension, and a bit of a modern flair to our
interfaces. When used thoughtfully, gradients can transform a flat,
monotonous design into a visually appealing and interesting experience.
Subtle gradients on the Design Manual‚Äôs page

---

## Chunk 151

Make no mistake, gradients are a powerful visual element, but they must
be used in moderation to avoid overwhelming the user. Sometimes
abusing gradients or making them blend poorly with result in a design
that looks cheap and unpolished. There‚Äôs a thin line between visually
interesting and simply not needed.

---

## Chunk 152

Let‚Äôs first talk about what gradient types you can find in UI and then cover
how to improve your gradient-making skills.

---

## Chunk 153

--- Page 56 ---
Linear gradient
Created by a straightforward linear change in color between two or more
colors. These gradients are the most common, creating a smooth
transition along a straight line. Ideal for backgrounds and buttons.
Buttons: A subtle gradient can make buttons appear more clickable or
stand out, especially in primary call-to-action buttons.

---

## Chunk 154

Login Login Login Login
Backgrounds: Gradients can break the monotony of flat backgrounds or
make certain elements more readable against busy backgrounds.

---

## Chunk 155

--- Page 57 ---
Radial gradient
Radial gradient typically consists of two color stops, one in the center and
one at the edge. By tweaking the colors and locations of these stops, you
can fine-tune the gradient to your liking. To make it blend better, drag one
of the gradient color stops inside the shape, towards the center.
Use radial gradients for overlays

---

## Chunk 156

You can also make the middle point transparent to create an overlay that
transitions from pure color to transparent, revealing the pattern, color, or
an obscured image below the overlay. Simply add a rectangle on top of
your pattern, turn fill into radial gradient with 100%-0% opacity color
stops, and watch the magic happen!

---

## Chunk 157

--- Page 58 ---
Angular gradient
By using an angular gradient, colors stops are placed around the circle.
It‚Äôs a bit harder to make the angular gradient work but they do create
awesome compositions when used right.
Diamond gradient
These types of gradients aren‚Äôt that commonly used although they can
produce very interesting effects, similar to how a ray of light shines on an

## Chunk 158

object. They have a rather sharp, diamond-like shape.
That‚Äôs where its name is coming from.

---

## Chunk 159

--- Page 59 ---
Mesh gradients
These are multi-color combinations that look quite abstract and don‚Äôt
follow any linear, or radial paths. There are a few ways to create them
manually layering simple shapes and adding blur effects, but easiest
would be to simply google ‚Äúonline mesh gradient generators‚Äù or by using
one of the available free Figma plugins.
How to pick gradient colors

---

## Chunk 160

You can pretty much create gradients with any color combination,
although there are a few guidelines you need to follow in order to make
them look smooth. Most importantly, you should choose colors with
similar hues to avoid abrupt transitions. By similar I mean sitting next to
each other on the color spectrum ->

## Chunk 161

Add more gradient points
If you want to create a multi-colored dynamic gradients with more
dynamic but also more seamless blending, try to pick colors sitting next
to each other on the hue bar, in between your 3 main gradient points.

## Chunk 162

gradient points as you move towards the right (or left) end.
Quick note: The same tips would apply to any type of gradient

## Chunk 163

--- Page 61 ---
Add noise and/or texture
Adding a grainy pattern on top of your gradient should add more depth to
your otherwise flat gradient backgrounds. Textures and noise is often
what turns UI designs from good to exceptional.
Use gradients as the ‚Äúsource of light‚Äù
Adding effects like Layer blur on top of your gradients can easily create a

attention towards a specific element like a button or a product mockup.

Most common UI elements
User Interface plays the most foundational role in the way users
experience a digital product, whether it‚Äôs a website, an app, or any smart
device, and UI elements are the tangible parts of interfaces users interact
with. They all contribute to forming the overall user experience.

## Chunk 206

Understanding the function, placement, and naming of these elements is
very important for every designer, as they collectively shape the user's
experience. Each element, from buttons and menus to forms and sliders,
plays a specific role in guiding users through an interface, making their
interactions intuitive and effective.

Intro to buttons
Buttons in UI serve as fundamental components that guide users through
their digital interactions. They‚Äôre used to complete tasks like move to
another page, complete a purchase or confirm an action.
They should be labeled with a clear Call To Action copy to enable users to
indicate specific activities. They simplify user interactions by enabling a

---

## Chunk 231

variety of actions with a single tap, initiating a specific process.

---

## Chunk 232

As one of the most important elements in UI design, buttons enable
actions like saving, sending, or downloading. As with any component,
designers must follow certain guidelines to create effective and
appealing buttons, ensuring they are both functional and inviting.
Enabled Pressed
Here are a few of the most important principles defined by Material

---

## Chunk 233

Design that should be followed when designing buttons:

---

## Chunk 234

Identifiable: Design your buttons to scream "click me!" They should
visually promise users that something happens when they're pressed.

Findable: Never play hide and seek with your buttons. They should pop
out, making it effortless for users to spot them and take action.

---

## Chunk 235

Clear: Clarity is king. This can be achieved through the use of descriptive
icons or straightforward, concise text labels. Don‚Äôt confuse users with
vague copy, use text that describes the action best.

---

## Chunk 236

--- Page 90 ---
The anatomy of a button
Let‚Äôs define a couple of important characteristics:
corner radius
I‚Äôm a button! padding
label
Button anatomy is rather simple. First, we have our text label, which
usually is between 14-20 px big. Next, we have our padding that
surrounds our button label. Usually (not always), the horizontal padding is

---

## Chunk 237

twice the size of the vertical spacing with total button height being
anywhere between 32-60 px. Material Design (by Google) suggests a
button height of at least 48px, Apple suggests height of 44px+. However,
because mouse clicks on desktop devices are more precise than finger
taps, desktop buttons can use heights ranging from 32-40px.

---

## Chunk 238

Lastly, we have our border radius. The reason behind using either sharp or
rounded corners relies heavily on your brand‚Äôs visual language. Use
rounded for more inviting, playful, and less serious designs. Use sharp
corners for more sophisticated designs. Let‚Äôs look at an example size
vertical padding: 10px +
text size: 14-17 px

Filled buttons (CTS)
Filled buttons stand out the most and are easily spotted, making them
perfect for primary calls to action (CTAs). They come with compelling
actionable text that prompts users to take a specific action.

Outlined buttons often called ‚Äúghost‚Äù buttons are secondary buttons

that indicate actions that are not primary but are also important.
Usually inviting a user to learn more about the product/service.

Link (tertiary) button
Often styled like text with reduced visual emphasis, are used for
secondary actions. You can underline them to aid users with visual
impairments in recognizing their interactivity. Can also be colored.

Button states
Buttons need states to differentiate them between each other. Each
button state must be easily distinguishable from the rest. Remember not
to take too drastic measures when modifying each state, it creates
unnecessary visual noise, and we want simplicity.

Size matters!
If the buttons are too small, it makes them incredibly hard to use and very
annoying to click. Buttons should be big enough to comfortably use them.
But how big is big enough?
mobile: 48 x 48px desktop: 164 x 48 px +

## Chunk 250

With desktop you‚Äôve got a bit more freedom but you have to remember -
your buttons will probably be the most important element on your page
so you need to make them prominent.
Use enough contrast
Combining the right colors for the button label and the font is essential.
Your button background and text colors must not only complement each
other, but the text has to be fully legible at all times.

## Chunk 252

Button text alignment
The button size and the font size are also important considerations. If you
have a button that‚Äôs 32 points and text that is 17 points, there is no way to
have the text aligned perfectly in the center. Adjust either one of these
values to match round numbers.
Let‚Äôs rock! Let‚Äôs rock!
Use of icons

---

## Chunk 253

Use icons along with text to give another visual cue about the button‚Äôs
purpose and communicate the meaning. A good rule of thumb is also to
lead with the icon rather than have it shown after the label.
Play video Play video
I received a ton of questions about this on my Instagram so here‚Äôs a little
explanation - It‚Äôs not a universal truth to put the icon first, it depends highly on the

## Chunk 254

context. It‚Äôs like with icon lists; you put the icon first as a visual aid for easier
content scanning and to quickly communicate action or purpose of the action.

---

## Chunk 255

If you put them on the right, they‚Äôre not helping in any way than to give the context
of where this action will lead them, like ‚ÄúLog out‚Äù followed by an icon of an open

If you want to direct users into taking specific actions you must guide
them in a proper and simple way. Using the right wording makes it easy to
understand what is the outcome of the button‚Äôs action.
Make it obvious enough so there‚Äôs no guessing.

## Chunk 258

Don‚Äôt use vague words like ‚Äúclick here‚Äù; users might be accessing your
site through a mobile phone or by using a keyboard, so apart from taking
non-obvious action, they‚Äôre not clicking but rather tapping at things.

---

## Chunk 259

--- Page 97 ---
Proper naming
Don't let users think too much during specific actions, especially the
easiest ones that don‚Äôt need additional thought. Send clear messages,
communicate in a simple and direct way.
Use action verbs to highlight what the outcome of clicking each button is.

Intro to forms
Forms are one of the most essential UI elements used to collect
information from the users. Understanding the right balance between

Labels
Keep your labels visible at all times. Offer an easy way to validate user‚Äôs
input. When forms are complex, it‚Äôs easy to get confused as to what fields
you‚Äôre currently filling out.
You could also use a special type of input field called ‚ÄúFloating label‚Äù to
save space while still providing the input information.

Optional vs required field
Keep your forms clutter-free. No need to mention which fields are
required or optional. You can either put an asterix beside required headers
or mark the optional fields. This creates enough visual cue to understand
that this field is different than the rest.
This has also been a highly discussed topic on my Instagram. According to most

---

## Chunk 271

UX studies the of use asterisks is not the best practice anymore and it even might
be a mistake. What‚Äôs the alternative to that?

---

## Chunk 272

Mark the optional fields instead of marking the required ones, users might feel
trapped and uncomfortable seeing red dots by the input labels. Typically, forms
have more required fields than optional ones, so marking only the optional fields
can also help reduce visual clutter, making the form appear less daunting and
more user-friendly as a result.

---

## Chunk 273

--- Page 104 ---
Use Actionable CTAs
Make the primary CTA prominent and offer a secondary button to cancel
the form. Also make it look like something you can actually click.
Error messages
Use error messages with incorrect data input. Add icons to add more
visual cues. Make them descriptive enough to help users understand
what step of the process they are wrong about and help them fix it faster.

---

## Chunk 274

--- Page 105 ---
Checkboxes vs radio vs dropdown
Take note of what input fields you choose. If you want to allow users to
choose more than one option - use checkboxes, if you want them to
choose only one - use a radio button or a select field.

---

## Chunk 275

Make each input type easy to understand. Try stacking them vertically,
rather than horizontally to avoid miss-clicks.
Good form UX is all about reducing the friction for your customers. If they
have to go out of their way and input information that‚Äôs troublesome to
type, your drop off rates will increase.
Make it as easy as possible for your users to complete their actions and

---

## Chunk 276

selecting the right input field will help you achieve that.

---

## Chunk 277

--- Page 106 ---
Input length and placeholder text
Match the input length to the width of the input field. Use descriptive
placeholder text to help users understand what the input should look like.
You want to make forms as compact and easy to fill as possible.
Compress fields and stack them next to each other; remove unnecessary

## Chunk 278

information to avoid friction. Do you need your users phone numbers
when charging subscriptions? If the answer is no, remove the field.

---

## Chunk 279

--- Page 107 ---
Input types
Mind the input types too. Some input fields are made specifically for
email fields, phone numbers, credit card numbers, file uploads etc.
Use them wisely!
This is not a must of course but it‚Äôs much easier to read and edit the
information when transferring your collected data into sheets and
documents. Think about the functionality behind your action when

designing for different systems.
Don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel if you don‚Äôt need to and focus on solving other,
more important problems instead.

---

## Chunk 281

--- Page 108 ---
Break it up
If your forms require a ton of input fields, consider splitting it into multiple
steps. This will help your users focus on one thing at a time. To do it right,
add a progress tracker, either by introducing steps, or a progress
indicator with percentages of completion.
immediate input validation
Give immediate input field confirmation (and validation) and indicate

---

## Chunk 282

progress as users are filling out their forms. Let them confirm their inputs
before continuing further down the flow. You can do that by either adding
a confirmation checkbox, highlighting your input in a different color, or
temporarily disabling the Continue button; just make sure it has sufficient
contrast and displays a toast/snackbar with instructions to follow.

---

## Chunk 283

Don‚Äôt forget about success states! You don‚Äôt want to leave your users
with no updates. Make sure they are fully aware of the form completion.

---

## Chunk 284

Remember about the accessibility!
While adding a beautiful background gradient and semi-translucent input
fields may seem like the ultimate designers flex, it‚Äôs often a bad choice for
your interface. Remember, you shouldn‚Äôt design for yourself!
‚Äì You should design for users. And not every user reads content the same

temporary visual impairments, or simply can‚Äôt focus enough to read

Intro to pricing sections
Designing an effective pricing section that drives conversions requires

customers towards making a purchase.

## Chunk 289

Each element, from the layout to the hierarchy, to the choice of words,
has a deeper meaning. Here are some essential practices and tips to help
you design a pricing page that converts.

Double the benefits or offer a freebie (if applicable)
If given the option, we always want to choose the most cost-efficient
plan. If you‚Äôre proposing an offer that your client really needs, then they‚Äôll
most probably use your service for a longer period of time. Give them a
trial run for one of the higher-priced services to set the right expectations.

---

## Chunk 292

By introducing a one-time project option we‚Äôve successfully added over
$100k worth or projects that all extended into retainers afterwards.
A risk-free offer/free trial on your pricing page might help reduce
conversion friction and encourage customers to purchase, but the price
shouldn‚Äôt be the only motivator to buy ‚Äì rather the value of your product.

---

## Chunk 293

If your competitors are running higher priced services yet still selling
more, maybe the value of your service is not there. Remember to work on
your product first and then minimize the friction and objections.

---

## Chunk 294

--- Page 113 ---
Highlight popular plans
When your offer consists of two, or more than two plans, choosing the
right one might be a little confusing for your clients.
Point them towards the most optimal option and let them know, either
upfront or through Frequently Asked Questions, that there‚Äôs an option to
scale the plan down or up when needed.

---

## Chunk 295

You can also add scarcity to further highlight the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù plan by
introducing interface elements with information about the limited
availability of your service or a product.
The psychological principle of scarcity makes the offer more attractive
simply because it seems more in demand or time-sensitive. Don‚Äôt
overuse it, though, people can sense if the information is genuine or if

invaluable in building trust and credibility.

Apart from that, you could include client reviews, trust badges, stars,
ratings, all displayed in a meaningful, and noticeable way. If you‚Äôre lacking

## Chunk 299

social proof, you could include security payment badges to let users know
their transaction is handled safely and is encrypted. Another way would
be to use logos of the tool stack your service is ‚Äúpowered by‚Äù. Building

If your product requires a long comparison table, then make sure to add a
sticky top pricing info for easier reference. It‚Äôs easy to get lost.
By keeping your pricing information constantly in view, you make it
effortless for users to compare different plans without the need to scroll
up and down the page.

---

## Chunk 301

Making your pricing info sticky has its advantages in usability and speed.
It lessens the number of clicks and scrolling needed to compare available
plans. Always keep important information front and center and try to
optimize the amount of steps (clicks) users need to take to reach a goal.

Psychological importance of pricing
When it comes to discounts, the way you frame them can make a big
difference. Implement pricing strategies that psychologically appeal to
your customers, like charm pricing (e.g., $9.95, $9.99 or $9 instead of $10).‚Ä®
For products priced below $100, percentage discounts often have a

## Chunk 303

stronger impact. For example, offering a 50% discount on a $50 item can
be more appealing than saying "$25 off." It's all about perception ‚Äì the
percentage seems like a larger, more significant saving.
On the other hand, for higher-priced items, say a product that costs
$1000, using a dollar amount can be more effective. A discount of "$200

## Chunk 304

off" can feel more substantial than saying "20% OFF." This is because,
with higher-priced items, the actual dollar savings appear more
considerable, making the offer more attractive.

## Chunk 305

Another effective strategy is using precise numbers, like $245 instead of
rounding up to $250. This approach can make the price appear more
thoughtfully calculated and less arbitrary, potentially increasing its
perceived value and trustworthiness. My favorite example is
@MrNick_Buzz design service pricing - $4179 and $6317 respectively. It
makes you stop and think why. Pretty intriguing.

Intro to dropdowns
Dropdowns, FAQs, and accordions are versatile UI components that help
organize content efficiently, making it accessible and user-friendly. This
chapter focuses on the best practices for designing these elements to
enhance user experience and interaction.
Simplify your choices
A general rule of thumb to follow is that if you have more than five

choices, then a drop down list could be the way to go. Dropdowns are
essential for compactly presenting options without breaking the user
flow, making them a must-have component in forms and dashboards.

A standard dropdown
A standard dropdown is a UI element that allows users to select one
option from a list of choices presented in a collapsible menu. It typically
consists of a header that displays the current selection or a prompt, and
when clicked or tapped, it expands to show a list of options.

Dropdown states
The primary states include default (when no selection is made), active
(when the user interacts with it), hover (when the cursor is over an option),
open (displaying the list of options), selected (after a choice is made), and
disabled (when the dropdown is inactive).

## Chunk 322

Subtle shadows and strokes
Adding subtle shadows and strokes to a dropdown can significantly
enhance its UX, particularly when it's placed against white or light
backdrops. These visual cues create a sense of depth and distinction,
making the dropdown stand out. This is especially crucial in minimalist
designs where color contrasts might be lower by designers‚Äô decision.

Provide a focused environment
When users are faced with an extensive list of options, scrolling through
them to find a specific item can be time-consuming and frustrating,
especially on mobile devices, a dropdown menu that expands into a
modal sheet with a search option offers an efficient solution.

## Chunk 325

When a user engages the dropdown, it transitions into a modal sheet,
providing a broader, more focused view for making a selection.

their desired option. Incorporating a search feature within a modal overlay

Nested dropdowns
This hierarchical structure is particularly useful for organizing complex

reveal related subcategories, allowing users to drill down to the exact
option they need.

## Chunk 332

Intro to navigation bars
One of the most important aspects of any website is its navigation. Good
navigation provides good user experience.
The navigation bar is a simple concept. It's essentially a list of links that
directs visitors throughout the site. A navigation bar can be considered as
the navigational ‚Äúanchor‚Äù of a page. It‚Äôs an essential element contributing

---

## Chunk 333

to time spent on-site, bounce rates, and in the case of service or product-
based websites, to some extent also conversions.
In this chapter, you‚Äôll learn a few simple tips on how to improve the
navigation of a website as well as how to improve the overall user
experience on your site.
Site logo link
Use navigational cues, such as including your primary brand logo in the

---

## Chunk 334

top left corner of the page. It‚Äôs essential to make the logo clickable as
some users may get lost on certain pages and want to quickly return to
the starting point. It‚Äôs a common practice and a well-known UX pattern.

---

## Chunk 335

--- Page 130 ---
Navbar link contrast
Make sure your links are easily visible and readable on your navigation bar
background. Remember about your interfrace‚Äôs required accessibility
values to provide usability for users with vision impairment.
This is especially important if you decide to add a semi-transparent
blurred background as your header navigation‚Äôs fill. Make sure to either

---

## Chunk 336

use a blending mode or alternate header variants on backgrounds with
lower contrast to make the links visible at all times.

---

## Chunk 337

--- Page 131 ---
Use short and concise names
Short navigation bar links are easier and faster for people to read and
understand. No need to overcomplicate things. Use simple and
understandable language for everyone, or at least your target audience.
Confusing or not prominent-enough CTA
Use a button, or a divider to differentiate the CTA from the rest of the

---

## Chunk 338

navigation bar. Increase or reduce the color contrast or increase the font
weight to make the CTA more prominent than regular header links.

---

## Chunk 339

--- Page 132 ---
Too many links
Think about responsive design and how you are going to present your
navigation bar on even the smallest desktop screens. Use dropdowns,
consider adding a mega-menu or move the extra links to the footer.
No hover states
Implement hover states for navigation links. These visual cues indicate
interactivity and help users understand which page they are currently

---

## Chunk 340

viewing. A change in color, underlining, or a background highlight can
indicate that the element is clickable.

---

## Chunk 341

--- Page 133 ---
No hover and active states
Always show the current position on the site. Add an active page highlight
so that users get another sensory cue of where they are on the website.
Consider adding sticky navigation
Make the navigation menu always easily accessible, regardless of how far
down the page a user has scrolled. You should eliminate the need for

---

## Chunk 342

users to scroll all the way back to the top to access other sections of the
site, thereby saving time and improving site navigability.
Sticky navigation is especially helpful for single-page landing pages

---

## Chunk 343

--- Page 134 ---
Add shadows to create depth
If you plan on making your header navigation sticky, you should consider
adding slight shadow or blur to give the illusion of elevation to your
interface elements. This will help you create a better visual hierarchy.
You could achieve a similar effect by adding a 0.5-1px stroke and creating
a line with just enough contrast to be noticeable.

---

## Chunk 344

Bottom 0.5px stroke 60% opacity + 24 blur
Another way would be to add a background blur to a value of about 20-32
and reducing the fill of your header navigation to 50-80%.

Intro to modal windows
Modals can significantly enhance the user experience by providing timely
information, guiding actions, and reducing navigational complexity. They
should be primarily reserved for critical interactions but they can also be
used to provide more context and information. Overusing them however,

---

## Chunk 366

can leave your users annoyed and less responsive, as more than often,
they are breaking the natural flow of the app or a website.

---

## Chunk 367

In this chapter we‚Äôll explore a few of the best practices for using modals,
ensuring they are both effective and user-friendly.
User controls and escape routes
It's extremely important to equip our users with control over their
interactions. For modal, that includes providing clear and intuitive ways to
close them, or accept them, such as a prominently displayed 'X' button,

---

## Chunk 368

clear CTAs, or enabling users to click outside the modal to dismiss it.

---

## Chunk 369

--- Page 143 ---
Responsive design
Modals should be designed responsively to ensure they are usable and
legible across different devices and screen sizes.
Progress indicators
Use them during long operations as loading indicators or progress bars.
This pattern should inform users about the ongoing process and help
manage their expectations regarding wait times.

---

## Chunk 370

--- Page 144 ---
Errors and irreversible actions
Not every error requires a modal interruption. Sometimes, inline error
messages or notifications are more appropriate and less disruptive.
However, certain actions, such as deleting an account, removing data, or
completing a major purchase, carry significant weight and consequences.

---

## Chunk 371

Implementing modals in these scenarios improves the user experience by
adding additional layer of safety before confirming destructive actions.
Deactivate account
Are you sure you want to deactivate your account?
Cancel Deactivate
Important note: Questions framed in a way that could lead to double
negatives should be avoided. For example, responding with 'No' to a

---

## Chunk 372

question phrased as "Are you sure you don't want to keep your
account?" can be confusing. It's better to frame the question positively
and clearly and tie it directly to the action they are taking.
Deactivate account
Are you sure you want to deactivate your account?
Yes No confusing labels

---

## Chunk 373

--- Page 145 ---
Guiding complex tasks
For complex tasks that involve multiple steps, modals can be an effective
way to guide users through the process without navigating away from the
current page. This keeps the user focused and reduces the cognitive load
of remembering multiple steps.

---

## Chunk 374

By incorporating a clear and explicit confirmation step, modals help users
make informed decisions, giving them a sense of control and
responsibility, enhancing the overall user experience.

experience by introducing a lot more steps, think if there‚Äôs a way to ask for
the required information without breaking the flow.

Intro to hero sections
The hero section in web design has subsequently evolved into an
essential component of every high-performing site. One of the main

businesses, to collect leads, and sell the products or services.

Content hierarchy
When building your hero sections mind the visual hierarchy. The F and Z
patterns are common scanning behaviors recognizable in hero section's
design. F-pattern is ideal for text-heavy hero sections, where key
information and CTAs are aligned to the left. Z-pattern on the other hand
is suitable for hero sections with a mix of impactful visuals and text,

---

## Chunk 381

typically with center-aligned elements. Choose the pattern and alignment
that best suits your content and goals, and design with users in mind.
Left-Aligned Heroes: These are scanned more easily, as they align with
the natural reading pattern in left-to-right languages. Users are more
likely to read most of the text, making this alignment suitable for

---

## Chunk 382

conveying detailed information or storytelling.

---

## Chunk 383

Center-Aligned Heroes: These often create a more balanced,
aesthetically pleasing look, especially when combined with striking
visuals. The central alignment draws user's eye to a specific focal point,
ideal for a strong, concise message or CTA. Great for quick scanning, not
so much for intensive reading. Use it for more visual impact.

---

## Chunk 384

--- Page 149 ---
Use clear and attention-grabbing headings
The power of a hero section is often anchored in its heading. A clear,
attention-grabbing heading is not just about using bold fonts or bright
colors; it's about crafting a message that resonates with your audience.

---

## Chunk 385

Your heading should be immediately understandable. Avoid jargon or
overly complex language. The goal is to communicate your message in
the simplest terms possible. Users should be able to understand your
value proposition or purpose of the site within seconds.

---

## Chunk 386

Tap into the emotions of your users. Whether it's excitement, curiosity, or
trust, the right emotional tone in your heading can create a deeper
connection with your audience. Let‚Äôs take our hero as an example:
Second heading might be more effective as it addresses both immediate
and long-term benefits, the desire for ease in the present and security for

the future. This dual focus connects emotionally with users, offering a
more comprehensive and engaging value proposition.

---

## Chunk 388

--- Page 150 ---
Call to actions
The CTA should be visually distinct from other elements on the page and
the language used in a CTA should be action-oriented to create a sense of
urgency or a benefit. Phrases like "Start A Free Trial," "Get started now,"
SmartBank Product Pricing Developers Resources Get the App
or "Become a member" are more compelling than generic phrases like

Secondary CTAs
They play an important role in providing users with additional, yet less

UI Cards

Intro to cards in UI
UI cards are versatile design elements that effectively organize and
display content in a digestible format. They present a preview of
information in a neat, compact way. Cards are widely used in interfaces to
showcase products, articles, profiles, and more, offering a visually
appealing and user-friendly way to navigate content.
Card Anatomy

---

## Chunk 417

A typical UI card includes a header (often with a title or icon), a main
content area (which can include text, images, or both), and usually a
footer with action buttons or links.
Most card components are universal although its layout depends on the
categories of content they include.

---

## Chunk 418

--- Page 158 ---
Ideal content length
The amount of content on a card should be carefully considered. Too
much information can overwhelm the user, while too little may not convey
enough value to take action. Aim for a balance that provides just enough
context to engage users without cluttering the card.
Keep the content concise. Users typically scan cards quickly, so it's

---

## Chunk 419

important to convey the message in as few words as possible while still
being clear and informative. Aim for short but snappy headlines and brief
descriptions that capture the essence of the content.

---

## Chunk 420

The content length should also adapt to the card's layout. For instance, in
a grid layout with multiple columns, shorter content is preferable to avoid
overwhelming the user. Alternatively, in a single-column layout, on mobile
for example, longer content may be acceptable as it's the only focus. If
your content is dynamic, consider truncating the text by adding ‚Äú...‚Äù

---

## Chunk 421

before having it break into another line.

---

## Chunk 422

--- Page 159 ---
Consistency across cards
Cards can be arranged in various column layouts, depending on the
content and available space. If you're using multiple cards, ensure
consistent content length across them. If your card content differs in title
and description lengths, consider the following tips to maintain uniformity
across your card designs.

---

## Chunk 423

Truncate the description or headings text by adding ellipses ‚Äú...‚Äù after text
reaches the text box width. You can consider providing a tool-tip for users
to read the full text if necessary, or set fill height on all card containers.
You can also set fixed minimum and maximum heights for content within
the cards. This approach keeps the layout tidy and predictable,

---

## Chunk 424

regardless of the content volume and it‚Äôs easy to achieve with CSS.

---

## Chunk 425

--- Page 160 ---
Visual hierarchy
Use typography and spacing to create a clear visual hierarchy. Headlines
should be prominent, followed by subheadings or brief descriptions. This
hierarchy guides users through the content in a logical manner.
Also, pay attention to the white space within and between cards.
Consistent spacing creates a clean and organized appearance, making

---

## Chunk 426

the content more approachable and easier to navigate.
If your cards include images, ensure they are of consistent quality, style,
and dimensions. Cropping images to a standard size and aspect ratio can
significantly improve the uniformity of the card layout.

---

## Chunk 427

--- Page 161 ---
Call to action(s)
Calls to Action (CTAs) on cards should be clear and compelling. Whether
it's a button to Read More', 'Buy Now', or ‚ÄòAdd to Cart,‚Äô the CTA should be
prominently placed and visually distinct to encourage user interaction.
The size of the CTA should be large enough to be easily tapped on touch

---

## Chunk 428

devices but not so large that it overwhelms the other content on the card.

---

## Chunk 429

Position the CTA in a location where it's logically expected, usually at the
bottom of the card. This placement follows the natural flow of reading
and makes it a natural endpoint after consuming the card's content.
For desktop interfaces, include hover and active states for the CTA.

---

## Chunk 430

--- Page 162 ---
Layout considerations
Cards can follow a horizontal (as grids) or vertical orientation (as lists), all
depending on the content and your preferences. They can include
images, videos, or text arranged in multiple ways.
Style considerations
Styling choices like adding borders, corner radius, and shadows can add
character to your cards. Borders can define the card's edges, while

---

## Chunk 431

rounded corners often give a softer, more modern feel. Shadows can
create depth, making cards 'pop', especially on lighter backgrounds.
However, these should be used in moderation to avoid visual clutter.

---

## Chunk 432

--- Page 163 ---
Spacing inside cards
As a good rule of thumb I leave between 16-24 px of padding inside of my
card elements. Horizontal padding is usually between 12-20px, while
vertical has 4-8px more to create more optical balance.

## Chunk 433

I also leave between 16-40px of space between each card in a row or
column layout to leave enough breathing room. As far as spacing around
card rows goes, I usually leave between 64-96px of padding between the
top and bottom of the card container section.

Main colors
To create your main color palette you‚Äôll need at least one primary color,
sometimes a secondary color, grays, and two shades, black and white.
That‚Äôs the base for our color palette. If you want something more
detailed, you can use a plugin like Foundation: Color Generator or Material
Theme Builder to help you create your tonal palettes.

Your styling should be documented in a style guide or a design system.

Component library
Building a component for every element and putting them into a library
makes future updates a lot more easier. If you need to change something,
you simply update the main component, and the change shows up
everywhere across your designs. This step isn't required, but it really
helps speed things up. Plus, it's a real game-changer for teamwork,

Early stages (and not only) of learning design
Now that we‚Äôve covered most of the UI basics, it‚Äôs time to give you a few
parting tips on how you can improve your design skills fast, and where to
go from here. In this chapter, we'll briefly take a look at my first mobile
designs, analyze them, and determine what‚Äôs wrong with them and how

## Chunk 480

applying certain design patterns and guidelines could help us improve
them. As you know by know, design is best learned by doing.
why this is not good?
and this is acceptable?
At the start, I knew some designs looked better than others, but I couldn't
figure out why. If you are anything like me, then you‚Äôve probably
experienced this feeling, or maybe you‚Äôre still experiencing it now. Why

---

## Chunk 481

are you able to tell when the design is good but you can‚Äôt replicate the
same quality? Michael Filipiuk said it best and I couldn‚Äôt agree more ‚Äì
it‚Äôs because your design taste is more developed than your skills.

---

## Chunk 482

--- Page 177 ---
I didn‚Äôt align my elements
I was pretty clueless when aligning my elements on a frame. I didn‚Äôt use
any grid layouts nor any spacing increments. All my elements were
‚Äúfloating‚Äù in random placements, with different widths and side margins
that I felt were right at the time. I probably didn‚Äôt even think about the
placement much back then. And that was a big mistake.

---

## Chunk 483

Aligning your content creates visual anchors, making it easier for users to
scan and process information. This alignment guides the eye smoothly
across the page, reducing cognitive load and improving readability.

---

## Chunk 484

From a UX perspective, a grid-based layout brings balance and order to a
design. Humans are naturally drawn to symmetry and balance, finding
them aesthetically pleasing and calming. Tap into this feeling.

---

## Chunk 485

--- Page 178 ---
I didn‚Äôt use proper spacing
My spacing was random. I didn‚Äôt use any symmetrically divisible values
(4pt grids), and it created a cluttered design that looked uneven. This
didn‚Äôt create any visual hierarchy and made the designs look unbalanced.

Larger spaces around more important elements draw attention to them,

---

## Chunk 486

while smaller spaces are used for less significant elements. This helps
users to quickly identify key information and navigation paths.
Effective spacing is even more crucial in the context of mobile design,
where screen real estate is limited. Larger spaces around more important
elements draw attention to them, while smaller spaces are used for less

---

## Chunk 487

significant elements. Use 8px as your smallest spacing increment and
keep increasing it to distinguish more important elements.

---

## Chunk 488

--- Page 179 ---
I didn‚Äôt use any type scale
I was always confused as to what font sizes I should use. This is especially
important as your text, next to space and color is the most important
element to establish a hierarchy. Look up type scales on HIG for iOS and
Material Design/Tailwind CSS for Android/Web, if you need help.

## Chunk 489

Using a type scale ensures that typography is consistent throughout your
design. This consistency is key to a professional-looking product.
A well-defined type scale takes into account the legibility of text at
different sizes and distances. This is especially important for mobile and
web interfaces, where readability can significantly impact the user

## Chunk 490

experience. Instead of guessing or arbitrarily choosing font sizes, you
have a set of guidelines to follow, which speeds up decision-making.

---

## Chunk 491

--- Page 180 ---
I was too creative
Every beginner shares a common trait: too much creativity. This early
enthusiasm often leads to a desire to showcase every idea and feature on
a single screen. However, this often lead to cluttered and overwhelming
interfaces. The key to effective UI design lies in simplicity and focus.

My designs weren‚Äôt consistent
Many beginner designers lack the consistency in their designs. Without a
unified approach, designs can appear disjointed and unprofessional. How
to overcome this challenge? Start by creating a style guide for colors,
text, and imagery, and apply these styles across your components.

I didn‚Äôt look at contrast values
Many beginner designers don‚Äôt look at accessibility requirements and we
always have to design with a large spectrum of users in mind. We
shouldn‚Äôt assume things, rather stick to industry standards.
contrast is too low - text is not legible
contrast is minimum 4.5:1
A few more considerations when designing for accessibility:

---

## Chunk 500

Use sufficient color contrast (for digital use AA is considered enough)
to ensure readability by users with visual impairments 
Ensure that all interactive elements are large enough to be easily
tapped or clicked - 44x44px on iOS, 48x48 on Android and Website 
Use plugins like A11y Contrast Checker to check your contrast value 
Design forms and navigation to be keyboard-friendly for users who

## Chunk 501

cannot use a mouse. Design focused component states.
While striving for aesthetic appeal, designers often underestimate the
role of contrast in enhancing usability and accessibility. It‚Äôs especially
visible on all the fancy dark mode designs you see shared online.

I followed all the bad examples
As a beginner, you might find yourself overwhelmed, trying to replicate
examples or follow advice that doesn't translate into practical skills.
Everyone can be an expert but not many are practicing what they preach.
Try to look up examples of portfolios and industry experience of the

## Chunk 503

people you ask for advice. I didn‚Äôt and I invested a lot of money and time
without learning anything usable.
The digital age has given rise to countless self-titled experts whose
advice may not always stem from real-world experience or success. It's
important to seek out design mentors or resources that not only talk the
talk but also walk the walk. Look for proven industry experience and a

---

## Chunk 504

portfolio that resonates with your aspirations.

---

## Chunk 505

Now, why should you listen to my advice? Well, I went through it all. After
years of struggle and self-learning I was able to ship my app designs to
over 30 million users, redesigned the biggest investment app in the UK,
and number #1 shopping app in Germany with the biggest launch
recorded in Germany‚Äôs history, rated 4.9 by over 5500 users.

## Chunk 506

But don‚Äôt get me wrong, you shouldn‚Äôt rely on just a single source. Design
is ever-evolving and so varied and complex that you should explore
multiple viewpoints to gain a well-rounded understanding.

## Chunk 507

Transitioning from the challenges of finding reliable design advice, I want

Tracing Designs
Start by taking screenshots. Choose an app or a website you admire and
download screenshots from its various flows/pages. You don‚Äôt have to
pay for these. Simply open the app on your phone and screenshot it.
Place these on your artboard, and just like that, begin your exercise.

Reduce the opacity of these screenshots to about 20%, lock the layer,
and start tracing the design, component by component.

---

## Chunk 521

Tracing will help you develop an eye for design details such as typography,
color usage, and the overall flow of elements. It's a practical way to
understand how experienced designers solve common design problems.

## Chunk 522

--- Page 188 ---
Want a bigger challenge?
For a more challenging exercise, place a screenshot beside your artboard.
Draw guidelines and replicate the design by referencing the screenshot.
This exercise is more challenging than tracing as it requires the designer
to think and make decisions about spacing, sizing, and alignment without

## Chunk 523

directly overlaying elements. It's a step closer to creating original designs
and helps in understanding the thinking behind certain design decisions.
Why is the title below the navigation?
Tabs are iOS segmented buttons
Label has stronger contrast
Cards have arrows to indicate action
Descriptions are greyed out Is this is an ad I can turn off?
Close button has low contrast - dark UX?

Dive deep into design analysis
Once you‚Äôre done, start examining how the replicated design addresses
user problems. Examine how the design uses visual hierarchy to prioritize
information. Notice what catches your eye first, second, and so on.
Analyze how elements like size, color, contrast, and placement are used
to draw attention and guide the user's eye through the design.

Analyze the copywriting. The words used in a design are as important as
the visual elements. Analyze the language for clarity, tone, and how it
complements the overall design. Good copy can significantly enhance
the user experience. The sooner you learn how to write, the better.

Once you replicate 10, 20, a 100 screens, you will be able to memorize so

As you replicate more and more designs, you naturally become faster
and more efficient in your design process. You learn shortcuts, become
proficient with design tools, and can quickly turn ideas into visual

Where to find good design examples
In our small design world, bad advice is everywhere and it can significantly
hinder your growth. It often sets unrealistic or inappropriate expectations
of what makes a good design. For beginners, it's easy to get swayed by
flashy visuals that show off more style than real substance. This can lead

---

## Chunk 532

to a messed up understanding of design principles and puts emphasis on
aesthetics at the cost of functionality and clarity.

---

## Chunk 533

A common trend among a lot of designers is to overload a design with
excessive visuals. While these designs might appear attractive at first
glance, they often detract from the core message of the site. The primary
focus of any design should be on the content and how effectively it
communicates with the audience. Overly complex designs can confuse

---

## Chunk 534

users, making it hard for them to find the information they need.

---

## Chunk 535

Platforms like Twitter and Instagram are increasingly showcasing designs
that are more about pleasing other designers than pure usability. These
platforms can sometimes promote a culture of design that values
appearance over functionality. They look impressive but often fail in
practical, real-world applications.

---

## Chunk 536

Good design is not just about how things look; it's about how they work.
Visuals should always support and enhance the message, not bury it. The
best designs are those where every element serves a purpose,
contributing to a clear, coherent, and compelling user experience.

---

## Chunk 537

To find good design examples, look beyond the superficial on social
platforms. Websites like Mobbin, Refero, Land-book, Onepagelove, and
