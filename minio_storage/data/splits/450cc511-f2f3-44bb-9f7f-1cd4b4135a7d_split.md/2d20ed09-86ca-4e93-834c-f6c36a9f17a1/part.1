THE PSYCHOLOGY OF DESIGN
Whether you‚Äôre designing a Web site or a medical device‚Äîor something somewhere in
between‚Äîyour audience is comprised of the people who will benefit from that design.
And the totality of your audience‚Äôs experience is profoundly impacted by what you
know‚Äîor don‚Äôt know‚Äîabout them.

---

## Chunk 31

How do they think? How do they decide? What motivates them to click or purchase
or whatever it is you want them to do?
You‚Äôll learn those things in this book.
You‚Äôll also learn what grabs their attention, what errors they will make and why, as
well as other things that will help you design better.
And you‚Äôll design better because I‚Äôve already done most of the heavy lifting for you.

---

## Chunk 32

I‚Äôm one of those strange people who likes to read research. Lots and lots of research.
SoI read‚Äîor in some cases, re-read‚Äîdozens of books and hundreds of research arti-
cles. I picked my favorite theories, concepts, and research studies.
Then I combined them with experience I‚Äôve gained throughout the many years I‚Äôve
been designing technology interfaces.

HOW
PEOPLE
SEE
Vision trumps all the senses. Half of the brain‚Äôs resources are
dedicated to seeing and interpreting what we see. What our eyes
physically perceive is only one part of the story. The images com-
ing in to our brains are changed and interpreted. It‚Äôs really our
brains that are ‚Äúseeing.‚Äù

## Chunk 35

WHAT YOU SEE ISN‚ÄôT WHAT
YOUR BRAIN GETS
You think that as you‚Äôre walking around looking at the world, your eyes are sending
information to your brain, which processes it and gives you a realistic experience of
‚Äúwhat‚Äôs out there.‚Äù But the truth is that what your brain comes up with isn‚Äôt exactly what

---

## Chunk 36

your eyes are seeing. Your brain is constantly interpreting everything you see. Take a
look at Figure 1.1, for example.
What do you see? At first you probably see a triangle with a black border in the back-
ground, and an upside-down, white triangle on top of it. Of course, that‚Äôs not really what‚Äôs
there, is it? In reality there are merely lines and partial circles. Your brain creates the

---

## Chunk 37

shape of an upside-down triangle out of empty space, because that‚Äôs what it expects to
see. This particular illusion is called a Kanizsa triangle, named for the Italian psychologist
Gaetano Kanizsa, who developed it in 1955. Now look at Figure 1.2, which creates a simi-
lar illusion with a rectangle.
THE BRAIN CREATESSHORTCUTS

---

## Chunk 38

Your brain creates these shortcuts in order to quickly make sense out of the world
around you. Your brain receives millions of sensory inputs every second (the estimate is
40 million) and it‚Äôs trying to make sense of all of that input. It uses rules of thumb, based
on past experience, to make guesses about what you see. Most of the time that works,
but sometimes it causes errors.

You can influence what people see, or think they see, by the use of shapes and col-
ors. Figure 1.3 shows how color can draw attention to one message over another.
FIGURE 1.3 Color and shapes can influence what people see
If you need to see in the dark, don‚Äôt look straight ahead.

Takeaways
What you think people are going to see on your Web page may not be what they do
see. It might depend on their background, knowledge, familiarity with what they are
looking at, and expectations.

## Chunk 52

You might be able to persuade people to see things in a certain way, depending on
how they are presented.

PERIPHERAL VISION IS USED MORE
THAN CENTRAL VISION TO GET THE
GIST OF WHAT YOU SEE
You have two types of vision: central and peripheral. Central vision is what you use
to look at things directly and to see details. Peripheral vision encompasses the rest
of the visual field‚Äîareas that are visible, but that you‚Äôre not looking at directly. Being

---

## Chunk 54

able to see things out of the corner of your eye is certainly useful, but new research
from Kansas State University shows that peripheral vision is more important in under-
standing the world around us than most people realize. It seems that we get informa-
tion on what type of scene we‚Äôre looking at from our peripheral vision.

Adam Larson and Lester Loschky (2009) showed people photographs of common

---

## Chunk 58

scenes, such as a kitchen or a living room. In some of the photographs the outside of
the image was obscured, and in others the central part of the image was obscured. The
images were shown for very short amounts of time, and were purposely shown with a
gray filter so they were somewhat hard to see (see Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2). Then they

---

## Chunk 59

asked the research participants to identify what they were looking at.
Larson and Loschky found that if the central part of the photo was missing, people
could still identify what they were looking at. But when the peripheral part of the image
was missing, then they couldn‚Äôt say whether the scene was a living room or a kitchen.

---

## Chunk 60

They tried obscuring different amounts of the photo. They concluded that central vision
is the most critical for specific object recognition, but peripheral vision is used for getting
the gist of a scene.

Takeaways
People use peripheral vision when they look at a computer screen, and usually decide

---

## Chunk 66

what a page is about based on a quick glimpse of what is in their peripheral vision.
Although the middle of the screen is important for central vision, don‚Äôt ignore what is
in the viewers‚Äô peripheral vision. Make sure the information in the periphery communi-
cates clearly the purpose of the page and the site.

---

## Chunk 67

If you want users to concentrate on a certain part of the screen, don‚Äôt put animation or
blinking elements in their peripheral vision.

PEOPLE IDENTIFY OBJECTS BY
RECOGNIZING PATTERNS
Recognizing patterns helps you make quick sense of the sensory input that comes to
you every second. Your eyes and brain want to create patterns, even if there are no real
patterns there. In Figure 3.1,you probably see four sets of two dots each rather than

---

## Chunk 69

eight individual dots. You interpret the white space, or lack of it, as a pattern.

THE GEON THEORY OF OBJECT RECOGNITION
There have been many theories over the years about how we see and recognize

---

## Chunk 71

objects. An early theory was that the brain has a memory bank that stores millions of
objects, and when you see an object, you compare it with all the items in your memory
bank until you find the one that matches. But research now suggests that you recognize
basic shapes in what you are looking at, and use these basic shapes, called geometric

## Chunk 72

icons (or geons), to identify objects. Irving Biederman came up with the idea of geons
in 1985 (Figure 3.2). It‚Äôs thought that there are 24 basic shapes that we recognize; they
form the building blocks of all the objects we see and identify.
The visual cortex is more active when you are imagining

Use patterns as much as possible, since people will automatically be looking for them.
Use grouping and white space to create patterns.
If you want people to recognize an object (for example, an icon), use a simple geomet-

ric drawing of the object. This will make it easier to recognize the underlying geons,
and thus make the object easier and faster to recognize.
Favor 2D elements over 3D ones. The eyes communicate what they see to the brain
as a 2D object. 3D representations on the screen may actually slow down recognition
and comprehension.

THERE‚ÄôS A SPECIAL PART OF THE
BRAIN JUST FOR RECOGNIZING FACES
Imagine that you‚Äôre walking down a busy street in a large city when you suddenly see
the face of a family member. Even if you were not expecting to see this person, and
even if there are dozens, or even hundreds, of people in your visual field, you will imme-

diately recognize him or her as your relative. You‚Äôll also have an accompanying emo-
tional response, be it love, hate, fear, or otherwise.
Although the visual cortex is huge and takes up significant brain resources, there is
a special part of the brain outside the visual cortex whose sole purpose is to recognize

## Chunk 79

faces. Identified by Nancy Kanwisher (1997), the fusiform face area (FFA) allows faces to
bypass the brain‚Äôs usual interpretive channels and helps us identify them more quickly
than objects. The FFA is also near the amygdala, the brain‚Äôs emotional center.
People with autism don‚Äôt view faces with the FFA

Christine Looser and T. Wheatley (2010) takes pictures of people and then morphs them
in stages into inanimate mannequin faces. She shows the stages and has research sub-
jects decide when the picture is no longer a human and alive. Figure 4.2 shows exam-
ples of her pictures. Looser‚Äôs research found that subjects say the pictures no longer

primarily use the eyes to decide if a picture shows someone who is human and alive.
FIGURE 4.2 An example of Looser‚Äôs and Wheatley‚Äôs people to mannequin faces
Takeaways
People recognize and react to faces on Web pages faster than anything else on the
page (at least by those who are not autistic).

---

## Chunk 88

Faces looking right at people will have the greatest emotional impact on a Web page,
probably because the eyes are the most important part of the face.
If a face on a Web page looks at another spot or product on the page, people will also
tend to look at that product. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that they paid attention to
it, just that they physically looked at it.

What‚Äôs interesting about these drawings is the angle and perspective. A few of the
cups are sketched straight on, but most are drawn from a perspective slightly above the
cup looking down, and offset a little to the right or left. This has been dubbed the canoni-
cal perspective. Very few people would draw a coffee cup as in Figure 5.3, which is what

you‚Äôd see if you were looking at a coffee cup from above.
Of course not, you say, but‚Ä¶why not? You might argue that the first perspective is the

PEOPLE SCAN SCREENS BASED ON
PAST EXPERIENCE AND EXPECTATIONS
Where do people look first on a computer screen? Where do they look next? It depends
partially on what they‚Äôre doing and expecting. If they read in a language that moves
from left to right, then they tend to look at the screen from left to right. If they read from

---

## Chunk 97

right to left, it is the opposite. However, they don‚Äôt start in the topmost corner. Because
people have gotten used to the idea that there are things on computer screens that are
less relevant to the task at hand, such as logos, blank space, and navigation bars (see
Figure 6.1), they tend to look at the center of the screen and avoid the edges.

PEOPLE HAVE A MENTAL MODEL OF WHAT THEY WANT TO SEE
AND WHERE THEY WANT TO SEE IT
People have a mental model of where things tend to be on computer screens, and a
mental model for particular applications or Web sites that they use. They tend to look at
a screen based on these mental models. For example, if they shop at Amazon a lot and

---

## Chunk 101

use the search field, they‚Äôll likely look right at the search field when the screen loads.
IF THERE IS A PROBLEM, PEOPLE NARROW THEIR VIEW
If there is an error or unexpected problem with the task people are trying to accomplish,
then they stop looking at other parts of the screen and focus on the problem area. We‚Äôll
discuss this more in the ‚ÄúPeople Make Mistakes‚Äù chapter.
Takeaways

---

## Chunk 102

Put the most important information (or things you want people to focus on) in the top
third of the screen or in the middle.
Avoid putting anything important at the edges, since people tend not to look there.
Design the screen or page so that people can move in their normal reading pattern.
Avoid a pattern where people have to bounce back and forth to many parts of the
screen to accomplish a task.

PEOPLE SEE CUES THAT TELL THEM
WHAT TO DO WITH AN OBJECT
You‚Äôve probably had the experience of encountering a door handle that doesn‚Äôt work
the way it should: the handle looks like you should pull, but in fact you need to push.
In the real world, objects communicate to you about how you can, and should, interact

---

## Chunk 105

with them. For example, by their size and shape, doorknobs invite you to grab and turn
them. The handle on a coffee mug tells you to curl a few fingers through it and lift it up.
A pair of scissors invites you to put fingers through the circles and move your thumb up
and down to open and close. If the item, like the door handle, gives you cues that don‚Äôt

---

## Chunk 106

work, you get annoyed and frustrated. These cues are called affordances.
James Gibson wrote about the idea of affordance in 1979. He described affordances
as action possibilities in the environment. In 1988 Don Norman modified the idea of affor-
dances in his book The Design of Everyday Things. He referred to the idea of perceived

---

## Chunk 107

affordances: if you want people to take action on an object, whether in real life or on a
computer screen, you need to make sure that they can easily perceive, figure out, and
interpret what the object is and what they can and should do with it.
When you try to accomplish a task, such as opening a door to a room or ordering a

---

## Chunk 108

book at a Web site, you automatically, and largely unconsciously, look around you to find
objects and tools to help you. If you are the one designing the environment for the task,
make sure that the objects in the environment are easy to see, easy to find, and have
clear affordances.
Take a look at the door handle in Figure 7.1. Because of its shape, you‚Äôll tend to grab

---

## Chunk 109

it and pull down. If that‚Äôs the way it works, then you‚Äôd say that the door handle is well
designed and that it has a clear perceived affordance.

to click on a button? Cues in the button‚Äôs shadow tell people that it can be pushed in,
the way a button on an actual device can be pushed in.
Figure 7.3 shows a button on a remote control. The shape and shadows give you
cues that encourage you to press the button to activate it.

You can simulate these shadows online, too. In Figure 7.4, shadows of different col-
ors around the edges make the button look pushed in. Try turning the book upside down
and looking at the same button. Now it will look like it‚Äôs not pushed in, and the shadows
will give cues to push the button.

These visual cues are subtle, but they are important. Many buttons on Web sites have
some of these visual cues, such as the button in Figure 7.5, but lately Web sites are los-

HYPERLINKS ARE LOSING THEIR AFFORDANCE CUES
Most people have figured out the affordance cue that blue, underlined text means that
the text is hyperlinked, and if you click on it you will go to a different page. But lately
many hyperlinks are more subtle, with the only cue that they are clickable showing up
when you hover. Figure 7.7 shows what the New York Times Reader page looks like

extra step to see the cues. And if you are reading on your iPad, all of these cues are

screen with your finger, you‚Äôve clicked on the link.

Think about affordance cues when you design. By giving people cues about what they
can do with a particular object, you make it more likely that they will take that action.
Use shading to show when an object is chosen or active.

If two items are near each other (a photo and text for example), then people assume

Takeaways
If you want items (pictures, photos, headings, or text) to be seen as belonging together,
then put them in close proximity.
Before you use lines or boxes to separate items or group them together, try experi-

The term color blindness is actually a misnomer. Most people who are ‚Äúcolor-blind‚Äù

to see differences between some colors. Most color blindness is hereditary, although

The rule of thumb is that wherever you use color to give specific meaning, you need
a redundant coding scheme, for example, color and line thickness, so that people who
are color-blind will be able to decipher the code without needing to see specific colors.

Check your images and Web sites with www.vischeck.com or colorfilter.wickline.org to
see how they will look to someone who is color-blind.
If you use color to imply a certain meaning (for example, items in green need immedi-
ate attention), use a redundant coding scheme (items in green and with a box around
them need immediate attention).

When designing color coding, consider colors that work for everyone, for example,
varying shades of brown and yellow. Avoid red, green, and blue.

THE MEANINGS OF COLORS
VARY BY CULTURE
Many years ago I worked with a client who had created a color map of the different
business regions for their company, showing the total revenue for the quarter for each
region. Yellow was for the eastern part of the U.S., green for the central states, and red

## Chunk 154

for the western states. The VP of Sales got to the podium and started his slide show to
the financial and accounting staff of the company. Up came the colored map and a gasp
could be heard in the auditorium, followed by the buzz of urgent conversation. The VP
tried to continue his talk, but he had lost everyone‚Äôs attention. They were all talking
amongst themselves.

---

## Chunk 155

Finally someone blurted out, ‚ÄúWhat the heck is going on in the West?‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù the VP asked. ‚ÄúNothing is going on. They had a great quarter.‚Äù
To an accountant or financial person, red is a bad thing. It means that they are losing
money. The presenter had to explain that he had just randomly picked red.
Colors have associations and meanings, for example, red means ‚Äúin the red‚Äù or finan-

cial trouble, or it could mean danger or stop. Green means money or ‚Äúgo.‚Äù Pick colors
carefully since they have these meanings. And different colors might mean different

consider the color meanings in other cultures. A few colors have similar meanings every-

colors have different meanings in different cultures. For example, in the U.S. white signi-

and funerals. Happiness is associated with white, green, yellow, or red, depending on
the part of the world you are in.

IT‚ÄôS A MYTH THAT CAPITAL LETTERS
ARE INHERENTLY HARD TO READ
You‚Äôve probably heard that words in uppercase letters are harder to read than those in
mixed case or lowercase. You‚Äôve probably even heard some kind of percentage cited,
such as ‚Äúbetween 14 and 20 percent harder.‚Äù The story goes that we read by recogniz-

## Chunk 166

ing the shapes of words and groups of words. Words in mixed case or lowercase letters
have unique shapes. Words in all capital letters have the same shape‚Äîa rectangle of a
certain size‚Äîso, in theory, they‚Äôre harder to distinguish (Figure 13.1).
FIGURE 13.1 The word shape theory
This explanation sounds plausible, but it‚Äôs not really accurate. There‚Äôs no research

## Chunk 167

showing that the shapes of words help us read more accurately or more quickly. A
psycholinguist named James Cattell came up with that idea in 1886. There was some
evidence for it then, but more recent work by Kenneth Paap (1984) and Keith Rayner
(1998) has revealed that what we‚Äôre actually doing when we read is recognizing and

---

## Chunk 168

anticipating letters. And then, based on the letters, we recognize the word. Let‚Äôs look
more closely at how we read.
READING ISN‚ÄôT AS FLUID AS IT SEEMS
When we read, we have the impression that our eyes are moving smoothly across the
page, but that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs actually happening. Our eyes move in quick, sharp jumps, with

---

## Chunk 169

short periods of stillness in between. The jumps are called saccades (about seven to nine
letters at a time) and the moments of stillness are called fixations (about 250 milliseconds
long). During the saccades, we can‚Äôt see anything‚Äîwe‚Äôre essentially blind‚Äîbut the move-
ments are so fast that we don‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre happening. Our eyes look forward

When it comes to fonts, size matters a lot. The font size needs to be big enough for
users to read the text without strain. And it‚Äôs not just older individuals who need fonts
to be bigger‚Äîyoung people also complain when font sizes are too small to read.
Some fonts can be the same size, but look bigger, due to the x-height. The x-height

is literally the height of the small letter x in the font family. Different fonts have different
x-heights, and as a result, some fonts look larger than others, even though they are the

READING A COMPUTER SCREEN IS
HARDER THAN READING PAPER
Computer screens, Kindles, and paper create different reading experiences. When you

being refreshed), and instead of emitting light the paper is reflecting light. The refresh-
ing of the image and emitting of the light on the computer display are tiring on the eyes.
Electronic ink (as in the Kindle) mimics the appearance of ink on paper. It reflects light
and holds the text stable without refreshing.

To make text on a computer screen easier to read, make sure you use a large enough

PEOPLE READ FASTER WITH A LONGER
LINE LENGTH, BUT THEY PREFER A
SHORTER LINE LENGTH
Have you ever had to decide what column width to use on a screen? Should it be a
wide column with 100 characters per line? Or a short column with 50 characters per
line? Or something in between? The answer depends on whether you want people to
read faster or to like the page.

---

## Chunk 220

Mary Dyson (2004) conducted research on line length, and combed other studies to
determine what line length people prefer. Her work showed that 100 characters per line is
the optimal length for on-screen reading speed; but we prefer a short or medium line length
(45 to 72 characters per line). Figure 18.1 shows examples of a short and long line length.

---

## Chunk 221

People read faster with a longer line length. We prefer a short line length

The research also found that we can read a single wide column faster than multiple
columns, but we prefer multiple columns, like those shown in Figure 18.2.

---

## Chunk 224

FIGURE 18.2 People read faster with one single-wide column, but they prefer multiple columns
If you ask people which they prefer, they will say multiple columns with short line
lengths. Interestingly, if you ask them which they read faster, they will insist it is also the
multiple columns with short line lengths, even though the data shows otherwise.
Takeaways

---

## Chunk 225

Line length presents a quandary: Do you give people the short line length and multiple
columns that they prefer, or go against their own preference and intuition, knowing that
they will read faster if you use a longer line length and a single column?
Use a longer line length (100 characters per line) if reading speed is an issue.

---

## Chunk 226

Use a shorter line length (45 to 72 characters per line) if reading speed is less critical.
For a multipage article, consider using multiple columns and a short line length
(45 characters per line).

SHORT-TERM MEMORY IS LIMITED
We‚Äôve all experienced this moment: you‚Äôre on the phone and the person you‚Äôre talking

have a pen or paper to write down the information, so you repeat the name and number

you can make the call while the number is still running through your head. You may find
that your memory isn‚Äôt very reliable in this situation.
Psychologists have many theories about how this type of memory works: some refer

of quick memory‚Äîthe memory you need for less than a minute‚Äîworking memory.

WORKING MEMORY AND FOCUSED ATTENTION
There‚Äôs only so much people can hold in working memory before they forget it. Informa-

ber a name and phone number, and someone starts talking to you at the same time,
you‚Äôre probably going to get very annoyed. You‚Äôre also going to forget the name and

working memory is tied to your ability to focus attention. To maintain information

PEOPLE REMEMBER ONLY FOUR
ITEMS AT ONCE
If you‚Äôre familiar with usability, psychology, or memory research, you‚Äôve probably heard
the phrase ‚Äùthe magical number seven, plus or minus two.‚Äù This refers, actually, to what
I would call an urban legend: George A. Miller (1956) wrote a research paper showing

---

## Chunk 249

that people can remember from five to nine (seven plus or minus two) things, and that
people can process seven plus or minus two pieces of information at a time. So you
should only put five to nine items on a menu, or have five to nine tabs on a screen.
Have you heard that story? Well, it‚Äôs not quite accurate.
WHY IT‚ÄôS AN URBAN LEGEND

---

## Chunk 250

Psychologist Alan Baddeley questioned the seven plus or minus two rule. Baddeley
(1994) dug up Miller‚Äôs paper and discovered that it wasn‚Äôt a paper describing actual
research; it was a talk that Miller gave at a professional meeting. And it was basi-
cally Miller thinking out loud about whether there is some kind of inherent limit to the
amount of information that people can process at a time.

---

## Chunk 251

Baddeley (1986) conducted a long series of studies on human memory and informa-
tion processing. Others, including Nelson Cowan (2001), folllowed in his footsteps. The
research now shows that the ‚Äúmagical‚Äù number is four.
USING CHUNKS TO TURN FOUR INTO MORE

tracted and their processing of the information is not interfered with.
One of the interesting strategies people employ to help our fragile memories is
‚Äúchunking‚Äù information together into groups. It‚Äôs no accident that U.S. phone numbers
look like this:
712-569-4532
Instead of having to remember 10 separate numerals, a phone number has three

---

## Chunk 253

chunks, with four or less items in each chunk. If you know the area code by heart (that is,
it‚Äôs stored in long-term memory), then you don‚Äôt have to remember that part of the num-
ber, so you can ignore one whole chunk.
Years ago phone numbers were easier to remember because you mainly called
people in your area code, so you didn‚Äôt have to hold the area code in working memory.

---

## Chunk 254

It was in long-term memory, which we will get to shortly. In the good old days you didn‚Äôt

even need to use the area code if the number you were calling from was in the same
area code as you were dialing from (not true anymore in most places). And to make it
even easier, everyone in town had the same exchange (the 569 part of the previous
phone number). If you were dialing someone in your town with the same exchange, all

---

## Chunk 256

you had to remember was the last four numbers. No problem! (I know I‚Äôm dating myself
here by telling you how it used to be back in the old days. I live now in a small town in
Wisconsin, and people here still give their number to others as the last four digits only,
even though just four numbers won‚Äôt work anymore).
THE FOUR-ITEM RULE APPLIES TO MEMORY RETRIEVAL, TOO

---

## Chunk 257

The four-item rule applies not only to working memory, but also to long-term memory.
George Mandler (1969) showed that people could memorize information in categories
and then retrieve it from memory perfectly if there were one to three items in a cat-
egory. The number of items recalled dropped steadily when each category contained

---

## Chunk 258

more than three items. If there were four to six items in a category, then people could
remember 80 percent of the items. It went down from there, falling to 20 percent if there
were 80 items in the category (Figure 20.1).

PEOPLE HAVE TO USE INFORMATION
TO MAKE IT STICK
How do people move things from working memory into long-term memory? There are
basically two ways: repeat it a lot, or connect it to something they already know.
REPETITION PHYSICALLY CHANGES THE BRAIN
There are 10 billion neurons in the brain that store information. Electrical impulses flow

---

## Chunk 264

through a neuron and are moved by neuron-transmitting chemicals across the synaptic
gap between neurons. Neurons in the brain fire every time we repeat a word, phrase,
song, or phone number we are trying to memorize. Memories are stored as patterns
of connections between neurons. When two neurons are activated, the connections
between them are strengthened.

---

## Chunk 265

If we repeat the information enough times, the neurons form a firing trace. Once the trace
is formed, then just starting the sequence triggers the rest of the items, and allows us to
retrieve the memory. This is why we need to hear information over and over to make it stick.
Experience causes physical changes in our brain. In a few seconds new circuits are

---

## Chunk 266

formed that can forever change the way we think about something or remember information.
THE POWER OF A SCHEMA
If I ask you to describe what a ‚Äúhead‚Äù is, you
might talk about the brain, hair, eyes, nose,
ears, skin, neck, and other parts. A head is
made up of many things, but you‚Äôve gathered
all that information together and called it
‚Äúhead.‚Äù Similarly I could talk about the ‚Äúeye.‚Äù

---

## Chunk 267

You would think about all the things that
make up an eye: the eyeball, iris, eyelash,
eyelid, and so on. The head is a schema. The
eye is a schema. People use schemata (plural
for schema) to store information in long-term
memory and to retrieve it.
If people can connect new information
to information that is already stored, then it‚Äôs FIGURE 21.1 A head is made up of eyes,

allow people to build up these associations in long-term memory. Just one schema helps
them organize a lot of information (Figure 21.1).
EXPERTS STORE INFORMATION AS SCHEMATA
The better people are at something, the more organized and powerful their schema
about it will be. For example, players who are new to the game of chess need a lot of

---

## Chunk 270

little schemata: the first schema might be how to set up the pieces on the board, the
second might be how a queen can move, and so on. But expert chess players can pile
a lot of information into one schema with ease. They can look at a chessboard in the
middle of a game and tell you what some of the starting moves were, the strategies for
each player, and what the next move

## Chunk 271

is likely to be. They could certainly
recite how to set up the board and
how each piece can move. What
would take many schemata for nov-
ice players, expert players can store
in one schema. This makes retrieval
of information faster and easier, and
makes it easier for the expert to put
new information about chess into
long-term memory. The expert can

Takeaways
If you want people to remember something, then you have to go over it again and
again. Practice really does make perfect.
One of the major reasons to do user or customer research is so that you can identify
and understand the schemata that your particular target audience has.

---

## Chunk 273

If people already have a schema that relates to information that you are providing,
make sure you point out what that schema is. It will be easier for them to learn and
remember the information if they can plug it into an existing schema.

IT‚ÄôS EASIER TO RECOGNIZE
INFORMATION THAN RECALL IT
Remember the memory test at the start of this chapter? Without looking at the list, write
down as many of the words as you can. We‚Äôll use this memory test to talk about recogni-
tion and recall.
RECOGNITION IS EASIER THAN RECALL
In the memory test you just took, you memorized a list of words, and later wrote them

down. This is called a recall task. If instead I had shown you a list of words, or even
walked you into the office and asked you which items were on the list, I would have
been giving you a recognition task. Recognition is easier than recall. Recognition makes
use of context. And context can help you remember.
INCLUSION ERRORS

---

## Chunk 276

All the words you memorized were things related to an office. Look at what you wrote
down, and compare your list with the original list at the beginning of the chapter. You
probably wrote words that weren‚Äôt even in the original list, but that go with the ‚Äúoffice‚Äù
schema. For example, you might have written down ‚Äúdesk‚Äù or ‚Äúpencil‚Äù or ‚Äúboss.‚Äù Con-

MEMORY TAKES A LOT OF
MENTAL RESOURCES
The latest research on unconscious mental processing shows that people receive
40 billion sensory inputs every second, and are consciously aware of 40 at any one
time. Doesn‚Äôt this mean that we can deal with and remember more than four things at
a time? When you perceive a sensory input (for example, a sound, the feel of the wind

## Chunk 281

on your skin, a rock that is in front of you), you perceive that something exists. You
don‚Äôt have to remember it necessarily or do something with the information. Conscious
awareness of 40 things is different than consciously processing 40 bits of information.
It takes a lot of mental resources to think about, remember, process, represent, and
encode information.
MEMORY IS EASILY DISRUPTED

---

## Chunk 282

Imagine you‚Äôre listening to a presentation at a conference. When the presentation is
finished, you meet your friend in the lobby of the hotel. ‚ÄúWhat was the talk about?‚Äù she
asks. You‚Äôre most likely to remember what was seen and heard at the end of the talk.
This is called the recency effect.
If your phone vibrates during a presentation and you stop listening for a minute to

PEOPLE RECONSTRUCT MEMORIES
EACH TIME THEY REMEMBER THEM
Think back to a particular event that happened at least five years ago. Maybe it was a
wedding, a family gathering, a dinner with friends, or a vacation. Remember the people,
and where you were. Maybe you can remember the weather, or what you were wearing.
MEMORIES CHANGE

---

## Chunk 294

When you think about this event, it probably plays in your mind like a short movie clip.
Because you experience memories this way, you tend to think that memories are stored
in their entirety and never change, like an archived movie. But that‚Äôs not what happens.
Memories are actually reconstructed every time we think of them. They‚Äôre not movie

---

## Chunk 295

clips that are stored in the brain in a certain location, like files on a hard drive. They are
nerve pathways that fire anew each time we remember the event. This makes for some
interesting effects. For example, the memory can change each time it is retrieved.
Other events that occur after the original event can change the memory of the origi-

---

## Chunk 296

nal event. At the original event, you and your cousin were close friends. But later on
you have an argument and a falling-out that lasts for years. Over time when you recall
the memory of the first event, it changes without you realizing it. It starts to include your
cousin being aloof and cold, even if that is not true. The later experience has changed
your memory.

---

## Chunk 297

You‚Äôll also start to fill in memory gaps with made-up sequences of events, but these
will seem as real to you as the original event. You can‚Äôt remember who else was at the
family dinner, but Aunt Jolene is usually present at these events, and so over time your
memory of the event will include Aunt Jolene, even if she wasn‚Äôt there.
WHY EYEWITNESS TESTIMONIES ARE UNRELIABLE

---

## Chunk 298

In her research on reconstructive memory, Elizabeth Loftus (1974) would show partici-
pants a video clip of an automobile accident. Then she would ask a series of questions
about the accident, and substitute critical words. For example, she might ask, ‚ÄùHow fast
would you estimate the car was going when it hit the other vehicle?‚Äù or ‚ÄùHow fast would

---

## Chunk 299

you estimate the car was going when it smashed the other vehicle?‚Äù And she would ask
the participants if they remembered seeing broken glass.
Notice the difference in using the word ‚Äúhit‚Äù versus ‚Äúsmashed.‚Äù When Loftus used
the word ‚Äúsmashed,‚Äù the estimated speed was higher than when she used the word
‚Äúhit.‚Äù And more than twice as many people remembered seeing broken glass if the word

IT‚ÄôS A GOOD THING THAT
PEOPLE FORGET
Forgetting things seems to be such a problem. At best it‚Äôs annoying (‚ÄúWhere did I put
my keys?‚Äù), and at worst it can send the wrong people to prison with inaccurate eyewit-
ness testimonies. How could something so maladaptive have developed in humans?
Why are we so flawed?

---

## Chunk 307

It‚Äôs actually not a flaw. Think about all the sensory inputs and experiences you have
every minute, every day, every year, and throughout your lifetime. If you remembered
every single thing, you‚Äôd be unable to function; you have to forget some things. Your
brain is constantly deciding what to remember and what to forget. It doesn‚Äôt always make

---

## Chunk 308

decisions that you find helpful, but in general, the decisions it makes (primarily uncon-
sciously) are keeping you alive!
A FORMULA TO SHOW YOU HOW MUCH YOU WILL FORGET
In 1886, Hermann Ebbinghaus created a formula showing the degradation of memories:
R = e(‚àít/S)
Where Ris memory retention, Sis the relative strength of memory, and tis time.

---

## Chunk 309

The formula results in a graph that looks like Figure 25.1. It‚Äôs called the Forgetting Curve,
and it shows that we quickly forget information unless it‚Äôs stored in long-term memory.

THE MOST VIVID MEMORIES
ARE WRONG
If I asked you to recall where you were and what you were doing when you first heard
about the September 11, 2001, attacks in New York City, chances are very good that
you could tell me about that day in great detail. If you live in the U.S., and you were age
ten or older on that date, your memory would likely include details such as how you

---

## Chunk 312

heard about the attacks, who you were with, and what you did the rest of that day. But
research shows that a lot of, perhaps even most of, your memories would be wrong.
FLASHBULB MEMORIES ARE VIVID
Remembering traumatic or dramatic events in great detail is called ‚Äúflashbulb memory.‚Äù
Emotions are processed in the amygdala, which is very close to the hippocampus, which

---

## Chunk 313

is involved in the long-term coding of information into memories. So it‚Äôs no surprise to psy-
chologists that emotionally laden memories might be very strong and remembered vividly.
VIVID BUT FULL OF ERRORS
Although flashbulb memories are vivid, they are also full of errors. In 1986 the space
shuttle Challenger exploded. If you to recall that event, you probably remember it viv-

## Chunk 314

idly. The day after this tragic event, Ulric Neisser, a professor who researches memo-
ries like these, he had his students write down their memories of what had happened.
Three years later he asked them to write their memory of the event again (Neisser,
1992). Over 90 percent of the later reports differed from the originals. Half of them

## Chunk 315

were inaccurate in two-thirds of the details. One person, when shown the description
she had written three years earlier, said, ‚ÄúI know that‚Äôs my handwriting, but I couldn‚Äôt
possibly have written that.‚Äù Similar research has been conducted on individuals with
memories of the 9/11 attacks, with similar results.
The Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve showed that memories degrade quickly over time.

---

## Chunk 316

Because flashbulb memories are so vivid, it was thought that perhaps they were not as
subject to forgetting as other memories. But it turns out they are. That‚Äôs kind of disturbing
when you think about it. Because these memories are so vivid, we tend to think they are
more true. But we are wrong.
Takeaways
If you know that someone had a dramatic or traumatic experience, you need to understand

HOW
PEOPLE
THINK
The brain has 23 billion neurons. That‚Äôs a lot of capacity for men-
tal processing. So what‚Äôs going on in there?
Understanding how people think is crucial if you‚Äôre going to
design for them. Just as there are visual illusions, there are also
thinking illusions. This chapter describes some of the interesting
things the brain does as it makes sense of the world.

PEOPLE PROCESS INFORMATION
BETTER IN BITE-SIZED CHUNKS
The brain can only process small amount of information at a time‚Äîconsciously, that is.
(The estimate is that you handle 40 billion pieces of information every second, but only
40 of those make it to your conscious brain.) One mistake that designers sometimes
make is giving too much information all at once.

activities, they get a little more information (Figure 27.2), and then they can go a level fur-

overwhelming them, and also address the needs of different people‚Äîsome may want a

multiple times. In fact, they won‚Äôt even notice they‚Äôre clicking if they‚Äôre getting the right
amount of information at each click to keep them going down the path. Think progres-
sive disclosure; don‚Äôt count clicks.
KNOW WHO NEEDS WHAT WHEN
Progressive disclosure is a great technique, but it assumes that you know what most

---

## Chunk 326

people want most of the time. If you haven‚Äôt done your research on that, then you could
end up with a frustrating site, with most people having to spend a lot of time searching
for the information they are looking for. Progressive disclosure only works if you know
what most people will be looking for at each part of the path.

Use progressive disclosure. Show people what they need when they need it. Build in
links for them to get more information.
If you have to make a trade-off on clicks versus thinking, use more clicks and less thinking.
Before you use progressive disclosure, make sure you‚Äôve done your research and
know what most people want and when they want it.

SOME TYPES OF MENTAL
PROCESSING ARE MORE
CHALLENGING THAN OTHERS
Imagine you‚Äôre paying bills at your online banking Web site. You have to think about
what bills need to be paid when, look up your balance, decide how much to pay on your
credit cards, and click the right buttons to get the payments processed. As you do this

---

## Chunk 332

task, there are things you‚Äôre thinking about and remembering (cognitive), things you‚Äôre
looking at on the screen (visual), and buttons you are pressing, mouse movements, and
typing (motor).
In human factors terminology, these are called loads. The theory is that there are
basically three different kinds of demands or loads that you can make on a person:

---

## Chunk 333

cognitive (including memory), visual, and motor.
ALL LOADS ARE NOT EQUAL
Each load uses up a different amount of mental resources. You use up more resources
when you ask people to look at something or find something on a screen (visual) than
when you ask them to press a button or move a mouse (motor). You use up more by

---

## Chunk 334

asking them to think or remember or do a mental calculation (cognitive), than when you
ask them to look at something on a screen (visual). So from a human factors point of
view, the order of the loads from most ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù to least is:
Cognitive
Visual
Motor
MAKING TRADE-OFFS
From a human factors point of view, when you‚Äôre designing a product, application, or

---

## Chunk 335

Web site, you‚Äôre always making trade-offs. If you have to add a few clicks, but it means
that the person doesn‚Äôt have to think or remember as much, that‚Äôs worth it, because
adding clicks is less of a load than thinking. I once did some research on this topic.
People had to go through more than 10 clicks to get the task done, and at the end they

---

## Chunk 336

would look up and smile and say, ‚ÄúThat was easy!‚Äù because each step was logical and
gave them what they expected. They didn‚Äôt have to think. Clicking is less of a load than
thinking.

USE FITT‚ÄôS LAW TO DETERMINE MOTOR LOADS
Although motor loads are the least ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù of the three loads, you often want to
reduce them. One way to reduce the motor load is to make sure that the targets you‚Äôre
asking people to hit aren‚Äôt too small or too far away, for example, when you ask them to

---

## Chunk 338

move a mouse across a screen and click a button or a small arrow on a drop-down box
to show a list of choices.
There is actually a formula that can be used to figure out how large a target should
be to enable someone to reach it reliably while moving a mouse across the screen. It‚Äôs
called Fitt‚Äôs Law. The formula is shown in Figure 28.1.
( )
D
T = a + b log 1+
2 W

---

## Chunk 339

FIGURE 28.1 The formula for Fitt‚Äôs Law
T is the average time taken to complete the movement (sometimes called MT
for Movement Time).
a is the start/stop time of the device (intercept) and b stands for the inherent
speed of the device (slope).
D is the distance from the starting point to the center of the target.
W is the width of the target measured along the axis of motion.

---

## Chunk 340

I don‚Äôt expect you to go calculate Fitt‚Äôs Law, but I include it here so that you realize
that there is a scientific way to determine how large a button or arrow should be.
The basic idea to keep in mind is that there is a relationship between speed, accu-
racy, and distance. For example, let‚Äôs say that you have a small arrow on the bottom right

---

## Chunk 341

of the screen and the user has to move the mouse from the top left to the bottom right to
click the small arrow. Fitt‚Äôs Law tells us that they will probably overshoot the arrow if they
move quickly, and they‚Äôll have to back up and go to the arrow.

SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO INCREASE LOADS
Most of the time when we consider loads in design, we‚Äôre looking to reduce the loads
(especially cognitive and visual) to make the product easier to use. But sometimes you
want to increase the load. For example, to grab someone‚Äôs attention you might add visual

---

## Chunk 346

information (pictures, animation, video) and thereby increase the visual load of the product.
The best example of purposely increasing loads is gaming. A game is an interface
where one or more of the loads have been intentionally increased to provide challenge.
Some games have high cognitive loads because you have to figure out what‚Äôs going on.

---

## Chunk 347

Some have high visual loads, where you have to find things on the screen. Some have
high motor loads, where you have to use the keyboard or a separate device to move the
cursor, or ‚Äúshoot‚Äù the villains. Many games increase more than one load, for example,
if the game has both visual and motor challenges.
Takeaways
Evaluate the loads of an existing product to see if you should reduce one or more

---

## Chunk 348

of the loads to make it easier to use.
When you design a product, remember that making people think or remember
(cognitive load) requires the most mental resources.
Look for trade-offs, for example, where you can reduce a cognitive load by increasing
a visual or motor load.
Make sure your targets are large enough to be easily reached.

MINDS WANDER 30 PERCENT
OF THE TIME
You‚Äôre at work reading a report that a colleague has written and you realize that you‚Äôve

Mind wandering is similar to but not the same as daydreaming. Psychologists use

daydreaming to refer to any stray thoughts, fantasies, or stories you imagine, for exam-
ple, winning the lottery or being a celebrity. Mind wandering is more specific: it refers to
doing one task and then fading into thinking about something unrelated to that task.
MIND WANDERING IS A VERY COMMON PHENOMENON
People underestimate mind wandering; according to Jonathan Schooler of the University

allow you to switch focus from one idea to another, and then back again quickly.
WHY A WANDERING MIND CAN BE A BAD THING

---

## Chunk 359

Much of the time when your mind wanders, you‚Äôre unaware of it. More ‚Äúzoning out‚Äù than
mind wandering, this means that you can miss important information. For example, if you
are supposed to be reading that report from your colleague, but you are instead think-
ing about what to make for dinner, that may just mean you are being unproductive. You
aren‚Äôt usually aware when you‚Äôre zoning out.

People will only focus on a task for a limited time. Assume that their minds are wander-
ing often.

## Chunk 362

If possible, use hyperlinks to grab onto this idea of quickly switching from topic to topic.
People like Web surfing because it enables this type of wandering.
Make sure you build in feedback about where people are so that if they wander, it‚Äôs
easier for them to get back to the original location or go to the next.

which I might decide to watch on my television via Apple TV. What the heck happened
here? (I describe the story of how I changed my loyalty from PCs to Apple in my book

league who was showing me his Android phone. He loves his new Android phone and
wanted to show me all the ways it was as good as, or better than, my iPhone. I was totally

to allow into my brain any information that would conflict with my opinion that anything

besides an iPhone was even a possibility. I was showing classical symptoms of cognitive
dissonance denial.
ALTER OUR BELIEFS OR DENY THE INFORMATION?
In 1956 Leon Festinger wrote a book called When Prophecy Fails.In it he describes the
idea of cognitive dissonance. Cognitive dissonance is the uncomfortable feeling you

---

## Chunk 368

get when you have two ideas that conflict with each other. You don‚Äôt like the feeling, so
you‚Äôll try to get rid of the dissonance. There are two main ways you can do that: change
your belief, or deny one of the ideas.
When forced, people will change their beliefs
In the original research on cognitive dissonance, people were forced to defend an

---

## Chunk 369

opinion that they did not believe in. The result was that people tended to change their
beliefs to fit the new idea.
70 HOW PEOPLE THINK

## Chunk 370

--- Page 84 ---
In new research by Vincent Van Veen (2009) had people ‚Äúargue‚Äù that the fMRI scan
experience was pleasant (it‚Äôs not). When ‚Äúforced‚Äù to make statements that the experi-
ence was pleasant, certain parts of the brain lit up (the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex
and the anterior insular cortex). The more these regions were activated, the more the

---

## Chunk 371

participant would claim that he really did think the fMRI was pleasant.
When not forced, people dig in
There‚Äôs another reaction that sometimes occurs. What if you are not forced to state that
you believe something you don‚Äôt; what if instead you are presented with information that
opposes your beliefs, but you are not forced to espouse a new belief. In these situations

---

## Chunk 372

the tendency is to deny the new information instead of changing your belief to fit.
If uncertain, people will argue harder
David Gal and Derek Rucker (2010) recently conducted research where they used fram-
ing techniques to make people feel uncertain. (For example, they told one group to
remember a time when they were full of certainty, and the other group to remember a

---

## Chunk 373

time when they were full of doubt.) Then they asked the participants whether they were
meat-eaters, vegetarians, vegans, or otherwise, how important this was to them, and
how confident they were in their opinions. People who were asked to remember a time
of uncertainty were less confident of their eating choices. However, when asked to write

---

## Chunk 374

up their beliefs to persuade someone else to eat the way they did, they would write
more and stronger arguments than those who were certain of their choice. Gal and
Rucker performed the research with different topics (for example, preferences for a Mac
versus a PC computer) and found similar results. When people were less certain, they
would dig in and argue even harder.
Takeaways

---

## Chunk 375

Don‚Äôt spend a lot of time trying to change someone‚Äôs ingrained beliefs.
The best way to change a belief is to get someone to commit to something very small.
Don‚Äôt just give people evidence that their belief is not logical, or tenable, or a good
choice. This may backfire and make them dig in even harder.

PEOPLE CREATE MENTAL MODELS
Imagine that you‚Äôve never seen an iPad, but I‚Äôve just handed you one and told you
that you can read books on it. Before you turn on the iPad, before you use it, you
have a model in your head of what reading a book on the iPad will be like. You have
assumptions about what the book will look like on the screen, what things you will

---

## Chunk 377

be able to do, and how you will do them‚Äîthings like turning a page, or using a book-
mark. You have a mental model of reading a book on the iPad, even if you‚Äôve never
done it before.
What that mental model in your head looks and acts like depends on many things. If
you‚Äôve used an iPad before, your mental model of reading a book on an iPad will be dif-

---

## Chunk 378

ferent than that of someone who has never used one, or who doesn‚Äôt even know what
an iPad is. If you‚Äôve been using a Kindle for the past year, then your mental model will
be different from someone who has never read a book electronically. And once you get
the iPad and read a couple books on it, whichever mental model you had in your head

## Chunk 379

before will start to change and adjust to reflect your experience.
I‚Äôve been talking about mental models (and their counterparts, conceptual models,
discussed below) since the 1980s. I‚Äôve been designing interfaces for software, Web
sites, medical devices, and various products for many years. I always enjoy the challenge

---

## Chunk 380

of matching what‚Äôs going on in people‚Äôs brains with the constraints and opportunities
presented by technology. Interface environments come and go (for example, the green
screen of character-based systems, or the blue screen of early graphical user interfaces),
but people change more slowly. Some of the age-old user interface design concepts are

still extremely relevant and important. Mental models and conceptual models are some
of the most useful design concepts that I believe have passed the test of time.

WHAT EXACTLY IS A MENTAL MODEL?
There are many definitions for mental models that have been around for at least
25 years. One of my favorites is from Susan Carey‚Äôs 1986 journal article ‚ÄúCognitive Sci-
ence and Science Education,‚Äù which states:
‚ÄúA mental model represents a person‚Äôs thought process for how something works

---

## Chunk 386

(i.e., a person‚Äôs understanding of the surrounding world). Mental models are based on
incomplete facts, past experiences, and even intuitive perceptions. They help shape
actions and behavior, influence what people pay attention to in complicated situations,
and define how people approach and solve problems.‚Äù
WHAT IS A MENTAL MODEL IN DESIGN?

---

## Chunk 387

In the field of design, a mental model refers to the representation of something‚Äîthe real
world, a device, software, and so on‚Äîthat a person has in mind. People create mental
models very quickly, often before they even use the software or device. Their mental
models come from their prior experience with similar software or devices, assumptions

---

## Chunk 388

they have, things they‚Äôve heard others say, and also from their direct experience with the
product or device. Mental models are subject to change. People refer to mental models to
predict what the system, software, or product is going to do, or what they should do with it.
Terminology can be confusing

PEOPLE INTERACT WITH
CONCEPTUAL MODELS
To understand why mental models are so important to design, you also have to under-
stand what a conceptual model is and how it differs from a mental model. A mental
model is the representation that a person has in his mind about the object he is interact-

---

## Chunk 394

ing with. A conceptual model is the actual model that is given to the person through the
design and interface of the actual product. Going back to the iPad ebook example, you
have a mental model of what reading a book will be like in the iPad, how it will work, and
what you can do with it. But when you sit down with the iPad, the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù (the iPad) dis-

---

## Chunk 395

plays what the conceptual model of the book app actually is. There will be screens and
buttons and things that happen. The actual interface is the conceptual model. Someone
designed an interface and that interface is communicating to you the conceptual model
of the product.
At this point you might be asking, ‚ÄúSo? Why should I care about this mental model/

---

## Chunk 396

conceptual model idea?‚Äù Here‚Äôs why you should care: if there is a mismatch between the
person‚Äôs mental model and the product‚Äôs conceptual model, then the product or Web
site will be hard to learn, hard to use, or not accepted. How do mismatches occur? Here
are some examples:
The designers thought they knew who would be using the interface and how

---

## Chunk 397

much experience they had with interfaces like this, and they designed accord-
ing to those assumptions without testing them, and it turns out their assump-
tions were wrong.
The audience or the product or Web site is varied. The designers designed
for one persona or type of audience, and the mental model and conceptual
model match for that group, but not for others.

---

## Chunk 398

There are no real designers. The conceptual model wasn‚Äôt really designed at
all. It‚Äôs just a reflection of the underlying hardware or software or database, so
the only people whose mental model it fits are the programmers. If the audi-
ence is not the programmers, then you‚Äôre in trouble.
WHAT IF IT‚ÄôS BRAND NEW AND I PURPOSELY WANT A MISMATCH?

---

## Chunk 399

What about the idea that people who have only read real, physical books will not have an
accurate mental model of reading books on the iPad? In this case you know that people
will not have an accurate mental model that fits. You want to change their mental model.
74 HOW PEOPLE THINK

---

## Chunk 400

--- Page 88 ---
Sometimes you know that the mental model of the target audience will not fit the con-
ceptual model, and instead of changing the design of the interface, you want to change
people‚Äôs mental model to match the conceptual model you‚Äôve designed. The way to
change a mental model is through training. You can use a short training video to change

---

## Chunk 401

their mental model before the iPad even arrives at their door. In fact, one of the best
purposes of training on a new product is to adjust the audiences‚Äô mental model to fit the
conceptual model of the product.

## Chunk 405

Design the conceptual model purposefully. Don‚Äôt let it ‚Äúbubble up‚Äù from the
technology.
The secret to designing an intuitive user experience is making sure that the conceptual
model of your product matches, as much as possible, the mental models of your audi-
ence. If you get that right, you will have created a positive and useful experience.

---

## Chunk 406

If you have a brand new product that you know will not match anyone‚Äôs mental model,
you‚Äôll need to provide training to prepare people to create a new mental model.

One day, many years ago, I found myself in front of a classroom full of user interface
designers who did not want to be there. Their boss had told them they had to attend
the talk I was giving. I knew that many or most of them thought the class was a waste of

---

## Chunk 408

time, and knowing that was making me nervous. I decided to be brave and forge ahead.
Certainly my great content would grab their attention, right? I took a deep breath, smiled,
and with a strong voice, I started the session with a big, ‚ÄúHello, everyone. I‚Äôm certainly
glad to be here.‚Äù More than half the class wasn‚Äôt even looking at me. They were reading

---

## Chunk 409

their e-mails and writing out to-do lists. One guy had the morning newspaper open and
was reading that. It was one of those moments where seconds seem like hours.
I thought to myself in panic, ‚ÄúWhat am I going to do?‚Äù Then I had an idea. ‚ÄúLet me tell
you a story,‚Äù I said. At the word story everyone‚Äôs head jerked up and all eyes were on

---

## Chunk 410

me. I knew I only had a few seconds to start a story that would hold their attention.
‚ÄúIt was 1988 and a team of Navy officers were staring at a computer screen. Some-
thing had just appeared on the radar in protected air space. They had orders to shoot
down any unknown aircraft. Was this an unknown aircraft? Was it a military plane? Was it

## Chunk 411

a commercial airliner? They had two minutes to decide what to do.‚Äù I had them! Everyone
was interested and riveted. I finished the story, which nicely made my point about why it
can be so important that they should care about designing usable interfaces that avoid
user uncertainty, and we were off to a great start. The rest of the day flew by, everyone

---

## Chunk 412

was interested and engaged, and I got some of my best teacher evaluations ever. Now I
make sure to use that magic phrase, ‚ÄúLet me tell you a story,‚Äù at least once in every talk I
give or class I teach.
You may have realized that what I did in the paragraph above was tell a story. Stories
are very powerful. They grab and hold attention. But they do more than that. They also

---

## Chunk 413

help people process information and they imply causation.
TRIED-AND-TRUE STORY FORMATS
Aristotle identified the basic structure of stories, and many people have expounded on
his ideas since. One model is the basic three-act structure: beginning, middle, and end.
This may not sound very unusual, but when Aristotle came up with it over two thousand
years ago it was probably pretty radical.

---

## Chunk 414

In the beginning you introduce your audience to the setting, the characters, and the
situation or conflict. In the story above I introduced you to the setting (I had to give a class),
the characters (me and students), and the conflict (the students don‚Äôt want to be there).
76 HOW PEOPLE THINK

---

## Chunk 415

--- Page 90 ---
My story was very short, so the middle part was short too. In the middle part of a
story, there are typically obstacles and conflicts that the main character has to overcome.
These are usually somewhat resolved, but not completely resolved. In my story above
the main character tried her usual opening and it failed. Then she started to panic.

---

## Chunk 416

In the end of the story the conflict comes to a climax and then is resolved. In my story
above I thought of what to do (tell a story to the class), which I did, and which succeeded.
This is just a basic outline. There are many variations and plots that can be added
and woven in.
CLASSIC STORIES
There are many stories that appear over and over in literature and in movies. Here are

## Chunk 417

some of the popular themes that have been identified:
The Great Journey Love
Coming of Age Fate
The Sacrifice Revenge
The Epic Battle The Trick
The Fall from Grace Mystery
STORIES IMPLY CAUSATION
Stories may create causation when none is there. Because stories usually involve some
form of chronological narrative (first this happens, next this happens), they imply causa-

---

## Chunk 418

tion even where none exists. Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons give this example
in their book The Invisible Gorilla (2010). Look at these two passages:
Joey‚Äôs big brother punched him again and again. The next day his body was covered
by bruises.
Joey‚Äôs crazy mother became furiously angry with him. The next day his body was
covered by bruises.

---

## Chunk 419

In the first passage you don‚Äôt need to assume much. Joey got punched and he has
bruises. He got the bruises from being punched. In the second passage the inference
is not quite so clear. Research shows that your brain will actually take a little bit longer
to ponder the second paragraph. Yet most people will conclude that Joey has bruises

---

## Chunk 420

because of his mother, even though the passage doesn‚Äôt say that. In fact, if you ask
people later to remember the passage, they will believe that they read in the story that
Joey‚Äôs mother actually hit him, even though that is not what the paragraph says.

People are quick to assign causality. Just as the visual cortex is filling in what you see
to find and detect patterns (see the ‚ÄúHow People See‚Äù chapter), our thought processes
do the same thing. You are always looking for causation. Your brain assumes you have
been given all the pertinent information and that there is causation. Stories make it even

Sometimes clients say to me, ‚ÄúStories are fine at some Web sites, but not the one I‚Äôm

Medtronic is a medical technology company. Take a look at their annual report. (The
online version is the same as the print version: http://216.139.227.101/interactive/mdc2010/).
The cover of the report is a high-quality photo of Antoinette Walters, a patient who was
helped by one of Medtronic‚Äôs products. Later in the report there is a short story about
Antoinette:

## Chunk 424

‚ÄúAntoinette Walters, shown here and on the cover, had such a severe lumbar scolio-
sis that the pain incapacitated her, and the deformity was progressively getting worse.
Then she underwent spinal fusion surgery using Medtronic spinal products to correct the
alignment. Today, Antoinette‚Äôs spine is much straighter, her pain is virtually gone, and she
is several inches taller.‚Äù

---

## Chunk 425

Antoinette‚Äôs is not the only story in the annual report. Sprinkled in with the financial
information are high-quality photos as well as stories about people like Antoinette and
employees who invented various technologies. The stories make the rest of the informa-
tion in the report more interesting, and also create a link between the financial numbers
and the stated mission of the company.

## Chunk 426

Takeaways
Stories are the natural way people process information.
Use a story if you want people to make a causal leap.

Screen shots or pictures are not the only way to provide examples. At the MailChimp
site there are also links to videos that walk you through the same steps (Figure 34.2).
Video is one of the most effective ways to give examples online. Videos combine move-
ment, sound, and vision, and don‚Äôt require reading, so they are attention-getting and
engaging.

PEOPLE ARE DRIVEN TO CREATE
CATEGORIES
If you‚Äôre between the ages of 5 and 60 and grew up with a television in the U.S., you
probably know what I mean if I say, ‚ÄúOne of these things is not like the other.‚Äù This is a
snippet from the popular children‚Äôs show Sesame Street.

The purpose of this Sesame Street lesson is to teach young children how to notice
differences, and essentially how to start to learn to categorize.

---

## Chunk 441

Interestingly, it‚Äôs probably unnecessary, and perhaps even ineffective, to try and
teach children how to create categories for two reasons:
People naturally create categories. Just as learning a native language hap-
pens naturally, so does learning to categorize the world around us.
Categorizing doesn‚Äôt emerge as a skill until about age seven. Thinking about

---

## Chunk 442

categories just doesn‚Äôt make sense to children before that. After age seven,
however, kids become fascinated with categorizing information.
PEOPLE LOVE TO CATEGORIZE
If you‚Äôve ever conducted a card-sorting exercise while doing research for Web site
design, then you‚Äôve had the experience of watching how avidly people approach the

---

## Chunk 443

task. In card sorting, you typically give someone a stack of cards. On each card is a
word or phrase about something they would find at the Web site. For example, if you‚Äôre
designing a Web site that sells camping equipment, then you might have a set of cards
that say things like: tents, stoves, backpack, returns, shipping, help. In a card-sorting

---

## Chunk 444

exercise, you give people the cards and ask them to arrange the cards into whatever
groups or categories make sense to them. You can have several people do the task,
then analyze the groupings, and have data from which to build the organization of your
Web site. I‚Äôve done this many times, including using it as an exercise in classes I teach.

## Chunk 445

It‚Äôs one of the most engaging tasks I have people do. Everyone gets very involved in
82 HOW PEOPLE THINK

## Chunk 446

this exercise, because people like to create categories. The whole field of information
architecture is about how to organize information into categories.
IF YOU DON‚ÄôT PROVIDE CATEGORIES, PEOPLE WILL
CREATE THEIR OWN
Just as the visual cortex imposes patterns on what we see, whether or not there are

---

## Chunk 447

really patterns there (see the ‚ÄúHow People See‚Äù chapter), people will impose categories
when they‚Äôre confronted with large amounts of information. People use categorization
as a way to make sense of the world around them, especially when they feel over-
whelmed with information.
WHO ORGANIZES DOESN‚ÄôT MATTER AS MUCH AS
HOW WELL IT‚ÄôS ORGANIZED

---

## Chunk 448

While working on my master‚Äôs thesis at Penn State, I conducted research on whether
people would remember information better if it was organized by other people or if
they organized it themselves. Basically what I found was that it didn‚Äôt really matter. What
mattered most was how well it was organized. The more organized the information, the

---

## Chunk 449

better people remembered it. Some people (those who measured high on ‚Äúlocus of
control‚Äù measures) preferred to organize the information in their own way, but self-orga-
nization versus other organization schemes didn‚Äôt really matter as long as the informa-
tion was well organized.
Takeaways
People like to put things into categories.

---

## Chunk 450

If there is a lot of information and it is not in categories, people will feel overwhelmed
and try to organize the information on their own.
It‚Äôs always a good idea to organize information for your audience as much as possible.
Keep in mind the four-item rule from the ‚ÄúHow People Remember‚Äù chapter.
It‚Äôs useful to get input from people on what organization schemes make the most

---

## Chunk 451

sense to them, but the critical thing is that you organize the material. What you call
things is often more important than how you have it organized.
If you‚Äôre designing sites for children under age seven, any organization into categories
you are doing is probably more for the adults in that child‚Äôs world, not for the child.

TIME IS RELATIVE
Has this ever happened to you? You‚Äôre traveling to visit friends. It‚Äôs two hours to get
there and two hours to get back, but the trip there feels much longer.
In the interesting book, The Time Paradox (2009), Philip Zimbardo and John Boyd
discuss how our experience of time is relative, not absolute. There are time illusions, just

---

## Chunk 453

like there are visual illusions. Zimbardo reports on research that shows that the more
mental processing you do, the more time you think has elapsed. Related to the progres-
sive disclosure discussed earlier in this chapter, if people have to stop and think at each
step of a task, they‚Äôll feel that the task is taking too long. The mental processing makes
the amount of time seem longer.

---

## Chunk 454

The perception of time and your reaction to it are also greatly influenced by predict-
ability and expectations. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre editing video on your computer. You‚Äôve just
clicked the button to produce the video file from your edits. Will you be frustrated by how
long it takes to produce the video? If you do this task often, and it normally takes 3 min-

## Chunk 455

utes, then 3 minutes will not seem like a long time. If there is a progress indicator, then
you know what to expect. You‚Äôll go pour yourself a cup of coffee and come back. But if it
sometimes takes 30 seconds and sometimes takes 5 minutes, and you don‚Äôt know which
one it‚Äôs going to be this time, then you will be very frustrated if it takes 3 minutes. Three

## Chunk 456

minutes will seem much longer than it usually does.
IF PEOPLE FEEL PRESSED FOR TIME, THEY WON‚ÄôT
STOP TO HELP SOMEONE
In the ‚ÄúGood Samaritan‚Äù research by John Darley and C. Batson (1973), Princeton semi-
nary students were asked to prepare a speech on either jobs for seminary graduates
or the parable of the Good Samaritan. The parable is about several holy men who pass

## Chunk 457

someone in need but don‚Äôt stop to help. The Samaritan comes upon the person in need
and does stop and help him. In the research study, the seminary students were asked to
prepare their talks, and then they were told to go to a building across campus and give
the talk. The experimenter gave the participants different instructions, depending on

## Chunk 458

whether they were in the Low, Intermediate, or High Hurry category:
Low Hurry: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be a few minutes before they‚Äôre ready for you, but you might
as well head on over. If you have to wait over there, it shouldn‚Äôt be long.‚Äù
Intermediate Hurry: ‚ÄúThe assistant is ready for you, so please go right over.‚Äù
High Hurry: ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre late. They were expecting you a few minutes ago.

---

## Chunk 459

You‚Äôd better get moving. The assistant should be waiting for you so you‚Äôd
better hurry. It should only take a minute.‚Äù

Each student was then given a 3 x 5 card with instructions about where to go. The
instructions took them past someone who was part of the experiment, and this person
was huddled and coughing and groaning in an alley on campus. The question was, how
many people would stop and offer help? Would it matter what talk they had been prepar-

ing to give? Would it matter what instructions they were given on whether to hurry or not?
What percentage of people stopped to help?
Low hurry: 63 percent
Intermediate hurry: 45 percent
High hurry: 10 percent
The type of talk the participants had prepared for (jobs versus the Good Samaritan
parable) didn‚Äôt make a significant difference in whether they stopped to help, but how

much of a hurry they were in did.
EXPECTATIONS CHANGE OVER TIME
Ten years ago if it took 20 seconds for a Web site to load, we didn‚Äôt think much of it. But
these days if it takes more than 3 seconds you get impatient. There‚Äôs one Web site I go

THERE ARE FOUR WAYS
TO BE CREATIVE
Have you heard someone say, ‚ÄúOh, John‚Äîhe‚Äôs so creative! I wish I was creative like
that.‚Äù It makes it sound as if creativity is a natural skill or talent, like the ability to sing or
paint. Other times people say, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to a seminar to learn how to be more creative.‚Äù

---

## Chunk 467

That makes it sound as if creativity is a skill that anyone can learn. So, which is it? Well,
both and neither.
Arne Dietrich (2004) wrote a paper on creativity from a brain and neuroscience point
of view. Dietrich identifies four types of creativity with corresponding brain activities:
Deliberate and cognitive creativity
Deliberate and emotional creativity
Spontaneous and cognitive creativity

DELIBERATE AND COGNITIVE CREATIVITY
Deliberate and cognitive creativity is the kind that comes from sustained work in a dis-
cipline. For example, Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light bulb as we know
it, was a deliberate and cognitive creator. He ran experiment after experiment before

---

## Chunk 471

he came up with an invention. In addition to the light bulb, Thomas Edison invented the
phonograph and the motion picture camera. He held 1,093 U.S. patents, and more in
Europe and the U.K. Some of his famous quotes include:
I am not discouraged, because every wrong attempt discarded is another step
forward.
I have not failed. I‚Äôve just found 10,000 ways that won‚Äôt work.

---

## Chunk 472

Many of life‚Äôs failures are men who did not realize how close they were to suc-
cess when they gave up.
Edison is a great example of someone who used deliberate and cognitive creativity.
According to Dietrich, this type of creativity comes from the prefrontal cortex (PFC).
The PFC is right behind your forehead. It‚Äôs not that the PFC is where creative thought

---

## Chunk 473

takes place; it‚Äôs more that the PFC allows you to do two things:
Pay focused attention.
Make connections among bits of information you‚Äôve stored in other parts of
your brain.
For deliberate, cognitive creativity to occur, you need to have a pre-existing body of
knowledge about one or more particular topics. When you‚Äôre being deliberatively and

---

## Chunk 474

cognitively creative, you‚Äôre putting together existing information in new and novel ways.
DELIBERATE AND EMOTIONAL CREATIVITY
I remember a moment many years ago when I was having a series of crises. A long-term
relationship had just ended in a difficult way. I had moved to a new city where I did not
know anyone. I had started a job I wasn‚Äôt sure I liked. I had rented an apartment that I

---

## Chunk 475

couldn‚Äôt really afford, and I was sleeping on a mattress on the floor because I couldn‚Äôt
afford to buy furniture. Then I discovered the apartment was infested with fleas. I took
all my clothes to the laundromat (I couldn‚Äôt afford a washer or dryer either), and when I
went back to retrieve them someone had stolen them. That was the last straw.

---

## Chunk 476

I remember sitting quietly in my office. I had to figure out why all these things were
happening. Why did I seem to be making a series of bad decisions? Then I had an a-ha
moment. In the ten years before the current crisis, I had some tough times, including both
of my parents dying. I had to be strong and independent and take care of myself. I had a
3377 THERE ARE FOUR WAYS TO BE CREATIVE 87

---

## Chunk 477

--- Page 101 ---
belief that said, ‚ÄúI am a strong person. I can handle any crisis.‚Äù I realized that I was making
decisions that would eventually cause more crises, at least partly so I could overcome
them to prove to myself that I was strong.
I decided right then to change my belief. I said out loud: ‚ÄúMy life is easy and grace-

---

## Chunk 478

ful.‚Äù I walked across the hall and asked a fellow coworker if I could stay in her apartment
for a few weeks until I found another place. I called my landlord and got out of the lease
on the flea-infested, too expensive apartment, and began to make decisions that would
make my life easier.
That is an example of deliberate, emotional creativity. This type of creativity also

---

## Chunk 479

involves the PFC. That is the deliberate part. But instead of focusing attention on a partic-
ular area of knowledge or expertise, people who engage in deliberate, emotional creativ-
ity have a-ha moments having to do with feelings and emotions. The amygdala is where
emotions and feelings are processed, in particular, the basic emotions of love, hate, fear,

---

## Chunk 480

and so on. Interestingly, the PFC is not connected to the amygdala. But there is another
part of your brain that also has to do with emotions. That is the cingulate cortex. This part
of the brain works with more complex feelings that are related to how you interact with
others and your place in the world. And the cingulated cortex is connected to the PFC.
SPONTANEOUS AND COGNITIVE CREATIVITY

---

## Chunk 481

Imagine you‚Äôre working on a problem that you can‚Äôt seem to solve. Maybe you‚Äôre trying
to figure out how to staff a project at work, and you just don‚Äôt see how to free up the right
people to do the project. You don‚Äôt have the answer yet, but it‚Äôs lunchtime and you‚Äôre
meeting a friend and need to run some errands, too. On your way back from errands and

---

## Chunk 482

lunch, you‚Äôre walking down the street and suddenly you get a flash of insight about how
to staff the project. This is an example of spontaneous and cognitive creativity.
Spontaneous and cognitive creativity involves the basal ganglia of the brain. This is
where dopamine is stored, and it is a part of the brain that operates outside your con-

---

## Chunk 483

scious awareness. During spontaneous and cognitive creativity, the conscious brain
stops working on the problem, and this gives the unconscious part of the brain a chance
to work on it instead. If a problem requires ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù thinking, then you need to
remove it temporarily from conscious awareness. By doing a different, unrelated activity,

---

## Chunk 484

the PFC is able to connect information in new ways via your unconscious mental pro-
cessing. The story about Isaac Newton thinking of gravity while watching a falling apple
is an example of spontaneous and cognitive creativity. Notice that this type of creativity
does require an existing body of knowledge. That is the cognitive part.
SPONTANEOUS AND EMOTIONAL CREATIVITY

---

## Chunk 485

Spontaneous and emotional creativity comes from the amygdala. The amygdala is
where basic emotions are processed. When the conscious brain and the PFC are at

rest, spontaneous ideas and creations can emerge. This is the kind of creativity that
great artists and musicians possess. Often these kinds of spontaneous and emotional
creative moments are quite powerful, such as an epiphany, or a religious experience.
There is not specific knowledge necessary (it‚Äôs not cognitive) for this type of creativ-

Takeaways (continued)
Deliberate and emotional creativity requires quiet time. You can provide questions or

answers quickly and just by interacting with others at a Web site. For example, creat-
ing an online support site for people with a particular problem might ultimately result in

deliberate and emotional creativity, but the person will probably have to go offline and
have quiet time to have the insights. Suggest that they do that and then come back
online to share their insights with others.
Spontaneous and cognitive creativity requires stopping work on the problem and get-
ting away. If you are designing a Web application or site where you expect people to

solve a problem with this kind of creativity, you will need to set up the problem in one

PEOPLE CAN BE IN A FLOW STATE
Imagine you‚Äôre engrossed in some activity. It could be something physical like rock
climbing or skiing, something artistic or creative like playing the piano or painting, or
just an everyday activity like working on a PowerPoint presentation or teaching a class.

---

## Chunk 501

Whatever the activity, you become totally engrossed, totally in the moment. Everything
else falls away, your sense of time changes, and you almost forget who you are and
where you are. What I‚Äôm describing is called a flow state.
The man who wrote the book on flow is Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. He‚Äôs been studying

---

## Chunk 502

the flow state around the world for many years. Here are some facts about the flow state,
the conditions that produce it, what it feels like, and how to apply the concept to your
designs:
You have very focused attention on your task. The ability to control and focus
your attention is critical. If you get distracted by anything outside the activity

---

## Chunk 503

you‚Äôre engaging in, the flow state will dissipate. If you want people to be in a
flow state while using your product, minimize distractions when they are doing
a particular task.
You‚Äôre working with a specific, clear, and achievable goal in mind. Whether
you‚Äôre singing, fixing a bike, or running a marathon, the flow state comes

---

## Chunk 504

about when you have a specific goal. You then keep that focused attention
and only let in information that fits with the goal. Research shows that you
need to feel that you have a good chance of completing the goal to get into,
and hold onto, the flow state. If you think you have a good chance of failing at
the goal, then the flow state will not be induced. And, conversely, if the activ-

---

## Chunk 505

ity is not challenging enough, then you won‚Äôt hold your attention on it and the
flow state will end. Make sure to build in enough challenge to hold attention,
but don‚Äôt make the tasks so hard that people get discouraged.
You receive constant feedback. To stay in the flow state, you need a constant
stream of information coming in that gives you feedback as to the achieve-

---

## Chunk 506

ment of the goal. Make sure you are building in lots of feedback messages as
people perform the tasks.
You have control over your actions. Control is an important condition of the
flow state. You don‚Äôt necessarily have to be in control, or even feel like you‚Äôre
in control of the entire situation, but you do have to feel that you‚Äôre exercis-

---

## Chunk 507

ing significant control over your own actions in a challenging situation. Give
people control at various points along the way.

## Chunk 508

Time changes. Some people report that time speeds up‚Äîthey look up and
hours have gone by. Others report that time slows down.
The self does not feel threatened. To enter a flow state, your sense of self and
survival cannot feel threatened. You have to be relaxed enough to engage all
of your attention on the task at hand. In fact, most people report that they lose

---

## Chunk 509

their sense of self when they are absorbed with the task.
The flow state is personal. Everyone has different activities that put them in a
flow state. What triggers a flow state for you is different from others.
The flow state crosses cultures. So far it seems to be a common human
experience across all cultures with the exception of people with some men-

---

## Chunk 510

tal illnesses. People who have schizophrenia, for example, have a hard time
inducing or staying in a flow state, probably because they have a hard time
with some of the other items above, such as focused attention, control, or the
self not feeling threatened.
The flow state is pleasurable. People like being in the flow state.

---

## Chunk 511

The prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia are both involved. I haven‚Äôt found
specific research on the brain correlates of the flow state, but given that
it combines time changes, pleasurable feelings, and concentrated focus,
I‚Äôm guessing it involves both the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for
focused attention, as well as the basal ganglia, which is involved in dopamine
production.

If you‚Äôre trying to design for, or induce, a flow state (for example, you are a game designer):
Give people control over their actions during the activity.
Break up the difficulty into stages. People need to feel that the current goal is challeng-
ing, yet achievable.
Give constant feedback.
Minimize distractions.

research that shows that how we think is influenced and shaped by culture.
EAST = RELATIONSHIPS; WEST = INDIVIDUALISTIC
If you show people from the West a picture, they focus on a main or dominant fore-
ground object, while people from East Asia pay more attention to context and back-
ground. East Asian people who grow up in the West show the Western pattern, not

---

## Chunk 515

the Asian pattern, thereby implying that it‚Äôs culture, not genetics, that accounts for the
differences.
The theory is that in East Asia, cultural norms emphasize relationships and groups.
East Asians, therefore, grow up learning to pay more attention to context. Western
society is more individualistic, so Westerners grow up learning to pay attention to
focal objects.

## Chunk 516

Hannah Chua et al. (2005) and Lu Zihui (2008) both used the pictures in Figure 39.1 and
eye tracking to measure eye movement. They both showed that the East Asian participants
spent more time with central vision on the backgrounds and the Western participants spent
more time with central vision on the foreground.

## Chunk 522

People from different geographical regions and cultures respond differently to photos
and Web site designs. InEast Asia people notice and remember the background and
context more than people in the West do.
If you are designing products for multiple cultures and geographical regions, then you
had better conduct audience research in multiple locations.

---

## Chunk 523

When reading psychology research, you might want to avoid generalizing the results if
you know that the study participants were all from one geographical region. Be careful
of overgeneralizing.

People are easily distracted in many situations. In fact, their attention can often be

## Chunk 528

pulled away from what they‚Äôre focusing on. But they can also pay attention to one thing
and filter out all other stimuli. This is called selective attention.
How difficult it is to grab their attention depends on how engrossed or involved they
are. For example, if they come to your Web site to shop for a gift and aren‚Äôt sure what to

---

## Chunk 529

get, it will be fairly easy to grab their attention with video, a large photo, color, or anima-
tion. Figure 40.1 provides a good example of this.

PEOPLE FILTER INFORMATION
Have you ever met someone who has a long-held belief that he just won‚Äôt change, no
matter how much evidence you show him that the belief is not tenable? People seek out
and pay attention to information and cues that confirm their beliefs. They don‚Äôt seek out‚Äî
in fact, they ignore or even discount‚Äîinformation that doesn‚Äôt support what they already

---

## Chunk 536

believe.
Filtering is often useful, since it reduces the amount of information we have to pay
attention to at any one time. But sometimes filtering can lead to bad choices.
In 1988 the U.S.Navy had a ship in the Persian Gulf called the USSVincennes.One
day, while scanning the radar screen on the ship, the crew saw an aircraft headed their

---

## Chunk 537

way. They decided early on that the approaching aircraft was not a commercial airliner,
but a hostile military plane. They shot down the plane, which did turn out to be a com-
mercial airliner with 290 passengers and crew on board. Everyone died.
Many factors led to this erroneous conclusion. The situation was stressful (I‚Äôll cover

---

## Chunk 538

stress in the chapter on People Make Mistakes), and the room was too dark. There were
many ambiguous pieces of information that made it hard for the Vincennes crew to under-
stand what they were looking at on their radar screen. Most significant, however, is what
they chose to pay attention to and what they chose to ignore. Several crew members were

---

## Chunk 539

convinced from the start that it was a hostile military plane, and from that point on they
filtered all the incoming information. They had repeatedly rehearsed the training scenario
on what to do when a hostile military plane entered their air space. They ignored evidence
that it was a commercial plane, paid attention only to the information that supported their

---

## Chunk 540

belief that it was a hostile military craft, and then proceeded to carry out the training sce-
nario. All of this led them to an incorrect conclusion.
Takeaways
Don‚Äôt expect that people will necessarily pay attention to information you provide.
Don‚Äôt make assumptions. What is obvious to you as the designer may not be obvious
to the people using what you‚Äôve designed.

---

## Chunk 541

If you think people might be filtering information, use color, size, animation, video, and
sound to draw attention to what‚Äôs important.
If it‚Äôs critical that people pay attention to certain information, make that information
stand out 10 times more than you think is necessary.

WELL-PRACTICED SKILLS DON‚ÄôT
REQUIRE CONSCIOUS ATTENTION
When my children were growing up they took music lessons using the Suzuki
method. My son studied violin, and my daughter studied piano. After attending one
of my daughter‚Äôs recitals, I asked her what she was thinking about while she was per-

---

## Chunk 543

forming the piano sonata from memory, with no music in front of her. The dynamics
of the music? When to get louder or softer? Particular notes or passages that were
coming up?
She looked at me in confusion.
‚ÄúThinking?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not thinking about anything. I‚Äôm just watching my fingers
play the song.‚Äù
It was my turn to be confused.

---

## Chunk 544

I turned to my son and asked, ‚ÄúIs that how you play the violin in a recital? Are you
thinking?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo, of course I‚Äôm not thinking,‚Äù he answered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm watching my fingers play the
violin, too.‚Äù
The Suzuki method stresses constant repetition. Students don‚Äôt have music in
front of them during recitals; instead, they memorize all the pieces, many of them quite

---

## Chunk 545

complicated. They practice their music so often, they learn how to play it without even
thinking.
If a skill is practiced so much that it becomes automatic, then it can be performed
with a minimum of conscious attention. If it‚Äôs truly automatic then it almost allows multi-
tasking. I say almost because multitasking doesn‚Äôt really exist.
TOO MANY AUTOMATIC STEPS CAN LEAD TO ERRORS

## Chunk 547

too long your fingers have taken over, and you aren‚Äôt even thinking about what you‚Äôre

Takeaways
If people perform a series of steps over and over again, the action will become
automatic.
If you require people to perform a sequence repeatedly, make it easy to do, but realize
that the trade-off is that people may make errors because they no longer are paying
attention.
Make it easy for people to undo not only their last action, but also an entire sequence.

---

## Chunk 549

Rather than requiring people to perform a task over and over, consider a design where
they can choose all the items they want to take action on and then perform the action
on all the items at once.

EXPECTATIONS OF FREQUENCY
AFFECT ATTENTION
Last year Farid Seif, a businessman from Houston, Texas, boarded a flight in Houston
with a loaded handgun in his laptop case. He made it through security without a prob-
lem. Seif was not a terrorist. The gun was legal in Texas; he simply forgot to take it out
of his laptop case before his trip.

---

## Chunk 551

Security at the Houston airport did not detect the gun. It should have been easily
seen by security personnel looking at the x-ray scanner, but no one noticed it.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security routinely tests the ability to pass security
screening with guns, bomb parts, and other forbidden items by sending them through with

---

## Chunk 552

undercover agents. The U.S. government won‚Äôt release the figures officially, yet, but the
estimate is that 70 percent of these tests fail, meaning most of the time the agents are able
to get through security, like Farid Seif, with objects that are supposed to be spotted.
Why does this happen? Why do security personnel notice the bottle of lotion that
is too large, but miss a loaded handgun?

A MENTAL MODEL ABOUT FREQUENCY
Security personnel miss the loaded handgun and bomb parts at least in part because

---

## Chunk 554

they don‚Äôt encounter them frequently. A security officer is working for hours at a time,
watching people, and looking at the scanner screen. He develops an expectation about
how frequently certain violations occur. For example, he probably encounters contain-
ers of hand lotion or nail clippers fairly often, and so expects to see those, and then

---

## Chunk 555

looks for them. On the other hand, he probably doesn‚Äôt encounter loaded handguns or
bomb parts very often. He creates a mental model about how frequently any of these
items will occur, and then, unconsciously, starts paying attention accordingly.
Andrew Bellenkes (1997) conducted research on this expectation and found that

---

## Chunk 556

if people expect something to happen with a particular frequency, they often miss it
if it happens more or less than their expectations. They have a mental model of how
often something will occur and they have set their attention to that mental model.

If you‚Äôre designing a Web site, you‚Äôre probably designing pages that someone views
for a lot less than seven minutes. You‚Äôre assuming that someone comes to the page,
looks for a link, and clicks on it. But sometimes you might be adding in other media,

---

## Chunk 565

such as audio or video. These media are subject to the 7 to 10 minute rule. TED videos
are typically 20 minutes long, so they‚Äôre going over the limit (although they have some
of the world‚Äôs greatest speakers, and so might be able to stretch it). Lynda.com does a
good job of keeping most of their online tutorials under 10 minutes.
Takeaways

## Chunk 566

Assume that you have at most 7 to 10 minutes of a person‚Äôs attention.
If you must hold attention longer than 7 to 10 minutes, introduce novel information or a

TO SALIENT CUES
Look at the pictures of a U.S. penny in Figure 45.1.Which one is the real penny? Don‚Äôt
cheat. Try and figure it out first, before you go get a penny to check.
FIGURE 45.1 Which is the real penny?
If you live in the U.S. and use U.S. coins, then a penny is something you‚Äôve probably

## Chunk 568

seen a lot. But you only pay attention to certain attributes of the penny, for instance, its
color and size. These are what psychologists call ‚Äúsalient cues.‚Äù You only pay attention to
what you need for the task at hand. Although there‚Äôs a lot of detail on the penny, a lot of
cues, the salient ones for most people are color and size. If you‚Äôre a coin collector, then

---

## Chunk 569

the salient cues are different. Salient cues for a coin collector might include the date,
wording, or particular pictures.
As we saw in the chapter on ‚ÄúHow People See,‚Äù you can look at something and not
really see it. Similarly, everyday you experience a lot of things through sight, sound, taste,
and touch that you don‚Äôt pay attention to. People are unconsciously aware that they have

---

## Chunk 570

limited resources, and the brain therefore decides what it really needs to pay attention to
and what it can ignore.
Did you guess the right penny? (It‚Äôs A.)
Takeaways
Decide what the salient cues are for your audience.
Design so that the salient cues are obvious.
Realize that people will probably only pay attention to salient cues.

PEOPLE CAN‚ÄôT ACTUALLY MULTITASK
I know it‚Äôs popular to think that you are multitasking, but the research is clear: people
can‚Äôt actually multitask. (There‚Äôs one specific, possible exception that I‚Äôll get to in a
moment.)
For many years psychology research has shown that people can attend to only

---

## Chunk 572

one task at a time. You can only think about one thing at a time. You can only conduct
one mental activity at a time. So you can talk, or you can read. You can read, or you
can type. You can listen, or you can read‚Äîone thing at a time. We are pretty good at
switching back and forth quickly, so we think we are multitasking, but in reality we
are not.
ONE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION

---

## Chunk 573

Research has uncovered one possible exception: if you are doing a physical task that
you have done very, very often, and you are very good at, then you can do that physical
task while you are doing a mental task. So if you are an adult and you have learned to
walk, then you can walk and talk at the same time. Well, maybe. Even walking and talking

---

## Chunk 574

doesn‚Äôt always work very well. A study by Ira Hyman (2009) showed that people talking
on their cell phones while walking ran into people (literally) more often, and didn‚Äôt notice
what was around them. The researchers had someone in a clown suit ride a unicycle.
The people talking on a cell phone were much less likely to notice or remember the
clown.

Next, they had people from each group perform several tasks. For example, they

showed people two red rectangles alone, or two red rectangles surrounded by four
or six blue rectangles. These objects were flashed twice, and the participants had to
decide whether the two red rectangles had moved from the first flash to the second.
They were supposed to ignore the blue rectangles.
What they found was opposite to what they thought they would find. The LMMs were

## Chunk 585

able to ignore the blue rectangles, but the HMMs had a harder time ignoring the blue
rectangles, and therefore did much worse on the task. Next they tried tasks that involved
letters and numbers. The results were always the same: the HMMs were actually more
distracted by irrelevant stimuli than the LMMs, and performed poorly on the tasks.

## Chunk 591

Have you ever wondered why traffic always slows when people are driving by an acci-

find that you glance over too as you drive by? Well, it‚Äôs not really your fault that you (and
everybody else) can‚Äôt resist looking at scenes of danger. It‚Äôs your old brain telling you to
PAY ATTENTION.

Takeaways
If you‚Äôre designing an application, you may have control over the sounds that occur
when a people take certain actions, for example, making a mistake, reaching a goal,
or donating money.
Pick a sound that is appropriate to the amount of attention you need. Save the high-
attention sounds for when it‚Äôs really important, for example, if people are about to

FOR PEOPLE TO PAY ATTENTION
TO SOMETHING, THEY MUST FIRST
PERCEIVE IT
For you to pay attention to something, you must be able to sense and perceive it. Here
are some examples of the sensitivity of your senses:
Sight:If you‚Äôre standing at a high point in total darkness, you can see a candle
30 miles away.

---

## Chunk 607

Sound:If you‚Äôre in a very quiet room, you can hear a watch ticking 20 feet away.
Smell: You can smell a drop of perfume in about 800 square feet of space.
Touch: You can feel a human hair on your skin.
Taste: You can taste a teaspoon of sugar in two gallons of water.
SIGNAL DETECTION THEORY
If you can‚Äôt find your watch, and you‚Äôre trying to figure out where you left it, then you‚Äôll

---

## Chunk 608

hear it ticking if you‚Äôre within 20 feet of it. But what if you aren‚Äôt looking for your watch?
What if you‚Äôre unconcerned with your watch, and instead you‚Äôre thinking about what to
have for dinner. In that case you may not even realize that there‚Äôs a watch ticking at all.
Detecting something is not necessarily simple. Your senses may perceive a stimulus,

---

## Chunk 609

but that doesn‚Äôt mean that you‚Äôre paying attention to it.
Sensitivity and bias
Imagine you‚Äôre expecting someone to come by and pick you up. They‚Äôre late, and you
keep running to the door thinking you heard the car in the driveway, even though you
didn‚Äôt.
Whether you perceive something or not depends on more than just the stimulus

---

## Chunk 610

being there. In fact, sometimes the stimulus is there and you miss it, and sometimes
it‚Äôs not there and you think you hear or see it.
Scientists call this signal detection theory. There are four possible outcomes, as
shown in Figure49.1.
This is not just a conceptual idea. There are real cases that signal detection research-

---

## Chunk 611

ers study. Take, for example, a radiologist who is looking at dozens of medical images
112 HOW PEOPLE FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION

## Chunk 612

every day. The radiologist has to decide if there is a small dot on the image and if it‚Äôs
cancer or not. If she sees a cancer dot when none is there (false alarm), then the patient
may have surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy when it‚Äôs unnecessary. On the
other hand, if she misses a cancer dot that was actually there, then the patient may die

## Chunk 613

because treatment was not given early enough. Psychologists study the different condi-
tions that make it more likely for people to detect a signal accurately.
Stimulus Present?
Yes No
Yes Hit False Alarm
You Detect?
No Miss Correct Rejection
FIGURE 49.1 Signal detection theory
HOW TO APPLY SIGNAL DETECTION THEORY
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre designing a new system for air traffic controllers to see how many

---

## Chunk 614

planes are near each other in the air space. You don‚Äôt want misses, so you turn up the
signal (use brighter lights, more sound) to make sure the controller doesn‚Äôt miss the sig-
nal. If you were designing the screen to show x-ray results for the radiologist, you would
turn down the signal a little bit to avoid false alarms.
Takeaways

---

## Chunk 615

If you‚Äôre designing for a particular task, think about the four quadrants of the signal
detection chart. Is it more damaging for people to have a false alarm or a miss?
Think about what you may need to do with your design based on the four quadrants of
the signal detection chart. If a false alarm is worse, then tone down the signal. If a miss
is worse, then make the signal stronger.

PEOPLE ARE MORE MOTIVATED AS
THEY GET CLOSER TO A GOAL
You‚Äôre given a frequent buyer card for your local coffee shop. Each time you buy a cup
of coffee you get a stamp on your card. When the card is filled, you get a free cup of
coffee. Here are two different scenarios:
Card A: The card has 10 boxes for the stamps, and when you get the card, all
the boxes are blank.

---

## Chunk 619

Card B:The card has 12 boxes for the stamps, and when you get the card the
first two boxes are already stamped.
Question: How long will it take you to get the card filled up? Will it take longer or
shorter for scenario A versus scenario B? After all, you have to buy 10 cups of coffee in
both scenarios in order to get the free coffee. So does it make a difference which card
you use?

---

## Chunk 620

The answer, apparently, is yes. You‚Äôll fill up the card faster with Card B than with
Card A.And the reason is called the goal-gradient effect.
The goal-gradient effect was first studied in 1934 by Clark Hull using rats. He found
that rats that were running a maze to get food at the end would run faster as they got to
the end of the maze.

---

## Chunk 621

The goal-gradient effect says that you will accelerate your behavior as you progress
closer to your goal.The coffee reward card scenarios I describe above were part of a
research study by Ran Kivetz (2006) to see if people would act like the rats did in the
original 1934 study. And the answer is, yes, they do. In addition to the coffee shop study,

---

## Chunk 622

Kivetz found that people would go to a Web site more frequently and rate more songs
during each visit as they got closer to a reward goal at the site.
The Dropbox Web site (Figure 50.1) shows how close you are to reaching a goal that
gives you extra storage space. As you get closer to the goal, you‚Äôll be more motivated to
take the one or two steps left to reach it.

VARIABLE REWARDS ARE POWERFUL
If you studied psychology in the twentieth century, you may remember B. F. Skinner
and his work on operant conditioning. Skinner studied whether behavior increased or
decreased based on how often, and in what manner, a reinforcement (reward) was given.
WHAT THE CASINOS KNOW

---

## Chunk 630

Let‚Äôs say you put a rat in a cage with a bar. If the rat presses the bar he gets a food
pellet. The food pellet is called the reinforcement. But what if you set it up so that the
rat does not get the food pellet every time he presses the bar. Skinner tested out vari-
ous scenarios, and found that the frequency with which you gave the food pellet, and

---

## Chunk 631

whether you give it based on elapsed time or bar presses, affected how often the rat
would press the bar. Here‚Äôs a synopsis of the different schedules:
Interval schedules. You provide a food pellet after a certain interval of time
has passed, for example, five minutes. The rat gets a food pellet the first time
he presses the bar after five minutes is up.

---

## Chunk 632

Ratio schedules.Instead of basing the reinforcement on time, you base it
on the number of bar presses. The rat gets a food pellet after every 10 bar
presses.
There‚Äôs another twist. You can have fixed or variable variations on each schedule.
If it‚Äôs a fixed schedule, then you keep the same interval or ratio, for example, every five

---

## Chunk 633

minutes or every 10 presses. If it‚Äôs variable, then you vary the time or ratio, but it aver-
ages out; for example, sometimes you provide the reinforcement after two minutes,
sometimes after eight minutes, but it averages out to five minutes.
So altogether there are four possible schedules:
Fixed interval. Reinforcement is based on time and the time interval is always
the same.

---

## Chunk 634

Variable interval. Reinforcement is based on time. The amount of time varies,
but it averages to a particular time.
Fixed ratio. Reinforcement is based on the number of bar presses, and the
number is always the same.
Variable ratio. Reinforcement is based on the number of bar presses. The
number varies, but it averages to a particular ratio.

OPERANT THEORY AND DESIGN
If you‚Äôre not sure that operant conditioning is related to design, think about it more
deeply. Many times as designers you want to encourage people to engage in a certain
behavior continuously. Skinner‚Äôs work is still relevant, but people don‚Äôt realize it. Take
the study by Kivetz in the beginning of this chapter. The rewards card is actually an

example of a fixed ratio schedule: you buy 10 cups of coffee (press the bar 10 times),
and then you get a free coffee.
At Dropbox.com, for every friend you get to join Dropbox you receive extra storage
space (Figure 51.2). This is called a continuous reinforcement schedule. (Skinner‚Äôs work
suggests that Dropbox might get better results if it gave a larger reward for every three or

---

## Chunk 646

five friends, in other words, if it switched to a fixed ratio schedule rather than a continuous
schedule).
FIGURE 51.2 For every friend who joins Dropbox, you get a reward

For operant conditioning to work, the reinforcement (reward) must be something that
particular audience wants. Hungry rats want food pellets. What does your particular
audience really want?

## Chunk 647

Think about the pattern of behavior you‚Äôre looking for, and then adjust the schedule of
rewards to fit that schedule. Use a variable ratio schedule for the maximum behavior
repetition.

You may have heard that dopamine controls the ‚Äúpleasure‚Äú systems of the brain that

behavior. It‚Äôs not only about physical needs such as food or sex, but also about abstract

UNPREDICTABILITY KEEPS
PEOPLE SEARCHING
Dopamine is also stimulated by unpredictability. When something happens that is not
exactly predictable, it stimulates the dopamine system. Think about electronic devices.
E-mails and tweets and texts show up, but you don‚Äôt know exactly when they will arrive,

## Chunk 661

or who they will be from. It‚Äôs unpredictable. This is exactly what stimulates the dopamine
system. It‚Äôs the same system at work for gambling and slot machines. Basically e-mail,
Twitter, and most social media run on the variable ratio schedule discussed earlier in this
chapter. That makes it likely that people will engage in the behavior again and again.
THE PAVLOVIAN REFLEX

---

## Chunk 662

The dopamine system is especially sensitive to cues that a reward is coming. If there is a
small, specific cue that signifies that something is going to happen, that sets off your dopa-
mine system. This is a Pavlovian response, named for the Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov who
experimented with dogs. When dogs (and humans) see food, they begin to salivate. Pavlov

---

## Chunk 663

paired food with a sound, for instance, a bell. The bell is a stimulus. Every time the dogs
saw food they would also hear a bell, and they would salivate at the sight of the food. After
a while the dogs would salivate at the sound of the bell. The food wasn‚Äôt even necessary
for salivation to occur. When a stimulus is paired with information-seeking behavior, such

## Chunk 664

as a sound and a message when a text arrives on your phone (Figure 53.1) or sound or
visual cue when an e-mail arrives in your inbox (Figure 53.2), you have the same Pavlovian
response‚Äîdopamine is released and the information seeking starts all over again.

140 CHARACTERS IS EVEN MORE ADDICTIVE
The dopamine system is most powerfully stimulated when the information comes in
small amounts, so that it doesn‚Äôt full satisfy the desire for information. A short text or a
tweet (which has a maximum of 140 characters) is ideally suited to sending the dopa-
mine system raging (Figure 53.3).
FIGURE 53.3 Short and frequent, Twitter messages

---

## Chunk 667

are ideal for stimulating the dopamine system
THE DOPAMINE LOOP
With the Internet, Twitter, and texting, you now have almost instant gratification of your
desire to seek. Want to talk to someone right away? Send a text and they respond in a
few seconds. Want to look up some information? Just type it into Google. Want to see

---

## Chunk 668

what your friends are up to? Go to Twitter or Facebook. You can get into a dopamine-
induced loop: dopamine starts you seeking, you get rewarded for seeking, and that
makes you seek more. It becomes harder and harder to stop looking at email, stop text-
ing, and stop checking your cell phone to see if you have a message or a new text.

Takeaways
Pairing cues such as sounds with the arrival of information motivates people to seek more.

---

## Chunk 672

Giving small bits of information and then providing a way for people to get more infor-
mation results in more information-seeking behavior.
The more unpredictable the arrival of information is, the more people will be addicted
to seeking it.

PEOPLE ARE MORE MOTIVATED
BY INTRINSIC REWARDS THAN
EXTRINSIC REWARDS
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre an art teacher, and you want to encourage your class to spend more
time drawing. You create a Good Drawing Certificate to give to your students. If your
goal is to have them draw more and to stick with it, how should you give them the cer-

---

## Chunk 674

tificate? Should you give them one every time they draw? Or only sometimes?
Mark Lepper, David Greene, and Richard Nisbett (1973) conducted research on this
question. They divided children into three groups:
Group 1 was the Expected group. The researchers showed the children the
Good Drawing Certificate and asked if they wanted to draw in order to get the
certificate.

---

## Chunk 675

Group 2 was the Unexpected group. The researchers asked the children
if they wanted to draw, but didn‚Äôt mention anything about a certificate. After
the children spent time drawing, they received an unexpected drawing
certificate.
Group 3 was the Control group. The researchers asked the children if they
wanted to draw, but didn‚Äôt mention a certificate and didn‚Äôt give them one.

---

## Chunk 676

The real part of the experiment came two weeks later. During playtime the drawing tools
were put out in the room. The children weren‚Äôt asked anything about drawing; the tools
were just put in the room and available. So what happened? Children in the Unexpected
and Control groups spent the most time drawing. The children in Expected group, the ones

---

## Chunk 677

who had received an expected reward, spent the least time drawing. Contingent rewards
(rewards given based on specific behavior that is spelled out ahead of time) resulted in less
of the desired behavior if the reward was not repeated. Later the researchers went on to do
more studies like this, with adults as well as children, and found similar results.

PEOPLE‚ÄôS ABILITY TO DELAY
GRATIFICATION (OR NOT)
STARTS YOUNG
You want to buy that Kindle, but you‚Äôre thinking maybe you should wait a while. Maybe you
should see if the price comes down later this year, or maybe you should pay down your
credit card debt before you spend money on a new gadget for yourself. Do you wait or not?

---

## Chunk 702

Whether you‚Äôre the type of person who can delay gratification or not, chances are
high that you‚Äôve been this way (a delayer or not a delayer) since you were a young child.
Starting in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Walter Mischel conducted a series of stud-
ies on delayed gratification. Years later he followed up with the original people in his

## Chunk 703

study. He found that when the people in the study who were able to delay gratification
became teenagers, they were more successful in school, received higher test scores on
the SAT, and were better able to cope with stress and frustration. He followed them into
adulthood and the differences continued. On the other side, the children in the original

PEOPLE ARE INHERENTLY LAZY
It might be exaggerating a bit to say that people are inherently lazy. But research does
show us that people will do the least amount of work possible to get a task done.
IS LAZY ANOTHER WORD FOR EFFICIENT?
Over eons of evolution, humans have learned that they will survive longer and bet-

## Chunk 708

ter if they conserve their energy. You want to spend enough energy to have enough
resources (food, water, sex, shelter), but beyond that you are wasting your energy if
you spend too much time running around getting or doing more stuff. Of course, ques-
tions about how much is enough, and whether we have enough stuff yet, and how long

---

## Chunk 709

should the stuff last (and on and on), still vex us, but putting the philosophical questions
aside, for most activities, most of the time, humans work on a principle called satisficing.
SATISFY PLUS SUFFICE EQUALS SATISFICE
Herbert Simon is credited with coining the term satisfice. He used it to describe a deci-
sion-making strategy in which the person decides to pick the option that is adequate,

---

## Chunk 710

rather than optimal. The idea of satisficing is that the cost of making a complete analysis
of all the options is not only not worth it, but may be impossible. According to Simon we
often don‚Äôt have the cognitive faculties to weigh all the options. So it makes more sense
to make a decision based on ‚Äúwhat will do‚Äù or what is ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù rather than trying

---

## Chunk 711

to find the optimal or perfect solution. If people satisfice rather than optimize, there are
implications for the design of Web sites, software, and other products.
DESIGN WEB SITES FOR SCANNING, NOT READING
In his book Don‚Äôt Make Me Think (2005), Steve Krug applies the idea of satisficing to the
behavior you can observe when someone comes to your Web site. You‚Äôre hoping the visi-

---

## Chunk 712

tor will read the whole page, but, as Krug says, ‚ÄúWhat they actually do most of the time (if
we‚Äôre lucky) is glance at each new page, scan some of the text, and click on the first link
that catches their interest or vaguely resembles the thing they‚Äôre looking for. There are
usually large parts of the page that they don‚Äôt even look at.‚Äù Krug talks about Web pages

Takeaways

## Chunk 719

Assume that people will get things done with the least amount of work possible. That

solution.

PEOPLE WILL LOOK FOR SHORTCUTS
ONLY IF THE SHORTCUTS ARE EASY
Do you use keyboard shortcuts when you‚Äôre typing on the computer? Do you use some,
but not others? Why do you do that?
People will look for ways to do something faster and with fewer steps. This is espe-
cially true if it‚Äôs a task they‚Äôre doing over and over. But if the shortcut is too hard to find,

---

## Chunk 721

or if a habit is ingrained, then people will keep doing it the old way. This seems paradoxi-
cal, but it‚Äôs all about the perceived amount of work. If it seems like too much work to find
a shortcut, then people will stay with their old habits (they are even satisficing about
satisficing).
PROVIDE DEFAULTS
Defaults reduce the amount of work needed to complete a task. When you provide

---

## Chunk 722

defaults, for example, filling in the person‚Äôs name and address automatically on a Web
form, then there is less work to finish the form. But there are some potential problems
with defaults. One is that people don‚Äôt always notice defaults, and so may end up
accepting a default without meaning to. Here again, the answer lies in the amount of

---

## Chunk 723

effort. If it takes a lot of work to change the result of accepting ‚Äúwrong‚Äù defaults, then
think twice about using them in your design.
When defaults create more work, not less
Recently I bought a pair of shoes for my online daughter. The next time I went to the
Web site, it was to buy a pair of shoes for myself. But the default shipping address was

---

## Chunk 724

the last address used‚Äîmy daughter‚Äôs, not mine. I didn‚Äôt notice that the shipping address
had filled in with a default that was not my home address. My daughter was surprised to
get a pair of shoes she hadn‚Äôt asked for. In this case, having a default operating meant a
lot more work for both my daughter and me.
Takeaways

---

## Chunk 725

Provide shortcuts as long as they are easy to learn, find, and use, but don‚Äôt assume
that people will always use them.
Provide defaults if you know what most people will want to do most of the time, and if
the result of choosing a default by mistake does not cause costly errors.

PEOPLE ASSUME IT‚ÄôS YOU,
NOT THE SITUATION
A man is walking down a busy city street on his way to an appointment, and he sees
what looks like a college student drop a folder of papers. The papers scatter on the
ground and the man glances over but keeps on walking. What do you think? Why didn‚Äôt
the man stop to help with the papers?

---

## Chunk 727

If you answer ‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs a self-absorbed person who doesn‚Äôt usually help out strang-
ers on the street,‚Äù then chances are likely that you have just made a fundamental attri-
bution error. People have a tendency to give personality-based explanations for other
peoples‚Äô behavior more weight than situational factors. Alternatively, instead of explain-

---

## Chunk 728

ing the person‚Äôs behavior in the story above as being due to his ‚Äúself absorption,‚Äù you
might ascribe his behavior to the situation, for example, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs late for a critical meeting
with the bank and doesn‚Äôt have time to stop today. In other circumstances he would have
stopped.‚Äù But in reality you don‚Äôt apply that situational motivation to him. You assume it‚Äôs

---

## Chunk 729

not the situation, but his personality that is causing his behavior.
BUT FOR YOU, IT‚ÄôS SITUATIONAL
On the other hand, if you‚Äôre analyzing and explaining your own behavior and motiva-
tions, then you will tend to think the opposite of what you attribute to others. In other
words, you assume that your motivation and behavior are based on a reaction to the

---

## Chunk 730

situation, not to personality factors. If you didn‚Äôt stop and help the person pick up the
papers, you would say it was because you were late for your meeting and didn‚Äôt have
time to stop, or some other situation-based explanation.
Research on the fundamental attribution error shows the following:
In cultures that value individualistic behavior (like the U.S.), it‚Äôs common to

---

## Chunk 731

ascribe other people‚Äôs behavior to personality. The fundamental attribution
error is common in these cultures.
On the other hand, in individualistic cultures people tend to ascribe their own
behavior to situational factors more than personality factors.
In cultures that value collectivist behavior (China, for example), people make the

---

## Chunk 732

same fundamental attribution error, but not as often as in individualist cultures.
Most of the research has to do with individuals deciding whether their actions are
influenced by their personality versus situational factors. It seems that they are. People
attribute the decisions of an ‚Äúother group‚Äù to the individual member‚Äôs attitudes, but attri-

ing, be careful of how you interpret or analyze the interviews. You‚Äôll have a tendency
to think about ‚Äúwhat people are going to do‚Äù based on personality and miss the situ-

FORMING A HABIT TAKES A LONG
TIME AND REQUIRES SMALL STEPS
When you turn on your computer each morning, you first open your email, then you go
on Facebook, then you go to weather.com to check the weather (or whatever your par-
ticular pattern is). You do this every day. It‚Äôs a habit. Why are you motivated to do these

## Chunk 744

same tasks every day? What did it take for these activities to become a habit? What
would it take to change the habit to something else?
Philippa Lally (2010) recently studied the ‚Äúhow‚Äù and ‚Äúhow long‚Äù of forming habits. She
had people choose an eating, drinking, or activity behavior to carry out every day for

---

## Chunk 745

12 weeks. In addition, the participants had to go online and complete a self-report habit
index each day to record whether or not they had carried out the behavior.
HOW LONG IT TAKES TO CEMENT A HABIT
The average amount of time it took for people to form a habit was 66 days, but that
number doesn‚Äôt really tell the story, because there was a wide range. For some people

---

## Chunk 746

and some behaviors it took 18 days, but depending on the person and the behavior, it
went all the way up to 254 days for the behavior to become an automatic habit. This is
a lot longer than has been written about before. Lally found that people would initially
show an increase in the automaticity of the behavior, and then they would hit a plateau:

their behavior followed an asymptote curve (Figure 60.1).

SOME BEHAVIORS BECOME HABIT FASTER THAN OTHERS
The more complex the behavior, the longer it took to become a habit (no surprise there).
Participants who chose to create an exercise habit took one-and-a-half times longer to
make it automatic than those who were building a new habit about eating fruit at lunch.
HOW BAD IS IT TO MISS A DAY?

---

## Chunk 749

Lally found that if people missed a day here and there, it didn‚Äôt have a significant effect
on how long it took to build the habit. But too many missed days, or multiple days in a
row, did have an effect, and slowed the creation of the habit. Not surprisingly, the more
consistent people were, the more quickly they reached the automatic point, although

---

## Chunk 750

missing one day did not delay habit formation. Missing two or more days did.

PEOPLE ARE MORE MOTIVATED TO
COMPETE WHEN THERE ARE FEWER
COMPETITORS
Did you take standardized tests like the SAT and ACT to get into college? How many
people were in the room when you took the test? What does it matter? Research by
Stephen Garcia and Avishalom Tor (2009) shows that it may matter a lot. Garcia and Tor

## Chunk 756

first compared SAT scores for locations that had many people in the room taking the test
versus locations that had smaller numbers. They adjusted the scores to control for the
educational budget in that region and other factors. Students who took the SAT test in a
room with fewer people scored higher. Garcia and Tor hypothesized that when there are

---

## Chunk 757

only a few competitors, you (perhaps unconsciously) feel that you can come out on top,
and so you try harder. And, the theory goes, when there are more people, it‚Äôs harder to
assess where you stand and therefore you‚Äôre less motivated to try to come out on top.
They called this the N effect, with N equaling number as in formulas.
COMPETING AGAINST 10 COMPETITORS
VS. COMPETING AGAINST 100

---

## Chunk 758

Garcia and Tor decided to test their theory in the lab. They asked students to com-
plete a short quiz, and told them to complete it as quickly and accurately as possible.
They were told that the top 20 percent would receive $5. Group A was told that they
were competing against 10 other students. Group B was told that they were compet-

---

## Chunk 759

ing against 100 other students. Participants in Group A completed the quiz significantly
faster than those in Group B‚ÄîGroup A had greater motivation knowing they were com-
peting against fewer people. The interesting thing is that there was no one actually in
the room with them. They were just told that other people were taking the test.
Takeaways

You‚Äôve heard people complain about self-service (‚ÄúWhat happened to the good old

DUNBAR‚ÄôS NUMBER
Evolutionary anthropologists study social groups in animals. One question they have
been trying to answer is whether there is a limit on how many individuals different spe-
cies have in their social group. Robin Dunbar (1998) studied different species of ani-

---

## Chunk 770

mals. He wanted to know if there was a relationship between brain size (specifically the
neocortex) and the number of stable relationships in social groups. He came up with a
formula for calculating the limit for different groups. Anthropologists call this Dunbar‚Äôs
number for the species.
THE SOCIAL GROUP SIZE LIMIT FOR HUMANS

---

## Chunk 771

Based on his findings with animals, Dunbar then extrapolated what the number would
be for humans. He calculated that 150 people is the social group size limit for humans.
(To be more exact, he calculated the number at 148, but rounded up to 150. Also there
is a fairly large error measure, so that the 95 percent confidence interval is from 100 to
230‚Äîfor you statistical experts out there).

## Chunk 776

There‚Äôs a limit to stable social relationships
The limit specifically refers to the number of people with whom you can maintain stable
social relationships. These are relationships where you know who each person is and
you know how each person relates to every other person in the group.
DOES THAT NUMBER SEEM LOW TO YOU?

---

## Chunk 777

When I talk about Dunbar‚Äôs number of 150 for humans, most people think that is way
too low. They have many more connections than that. Actually 150 is the group size for
communities that have a high incentive to stay together. If the group has intense survival
pressure, then it stays at the 150 member mark, and stays in close physical proximity. If

---

## Chunk 778

the survival pressure is not intense, or the group is physically dispersed, then he esti-
mates the number would be even lower. This means that, for most of us in our modern
society, the number would not even be as high as 150. In the world of social media, peo-
ple may have 750 Facebook friends, and 4,000 Twitter followers. A Dunbar‚Äôs number

---

## Chunk 779

advocate, however, would respond that these are not the strong, stable relationships
that Dunbar is talking about, where everyone knows everyone and people are in close
proximity.
IS IT THE WEAK TIES THAT ARE IMPORTANT?
Some critics of Dunbar‚Äôs number say that what‚Äôs really important in social media is
not the strong ties that Dunbar talks about, but the weak ties‚Äîrelationships that don‚Äôt

---

## Chunk 780

require everyone to know everyone else in the group, and which are not based on
physical proximity. (Weak does not imply less important in this context.) Jacob Morgan,
a social business advisor, argues that we find social media so interesting because they
allow us to quickly and easily expand these ‚Äúweak‚Äù ties, and that those ties are most
relevant in our modern world.

Takeaways
There is a limit of approximately 150 people for your ‚Äúsurvival‚Äù community in close
proximity. If you don‚Äôt feel you have that ‚Äútribe‚Äù around you, you may feel alienated,
isolated, and stressed.
Your relationships with larger numbers of people through social media are likely
weak ties.

## Chunk 784

When you are designing a product that has social connections built in or implied, think
about whether those interactions are for strong or weak ties.
If you are designing for strong ties, you need to build in some amount of physical prox-
imity, and make it possible for people to interact and know each other in the network.

If you are designing for weak ties, don‚Äôt rely on direct communication among all people

If you put your face right in front of a baby and stick out your tongue, the baby will stick

behavior.
MIRROR NEURONS FIRING

ment). This is not the part of the brain that actually sends out the signals that make you

move. That part of the brain is the primary motor cortex. The premotor cortex makes
plans to move.
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre holding an ice cream cone. You notice that the ice cream is dripping,

Synchronous activities are actions you take together with others, where everyone
is doing the same thing at the same time in physical proximity to one another. Dancing,
tai chi, yoga, singing, and chanting in time as a group are all examples of synchronous
activity.

Wiltermuth and Heath‚Äôs research also showed that you don‚Äôt have to feel good
about the group, or the group activity, in order to be more cooperative. Just the act of

members.
Do people need synchronous activity to be happy?

Takeaways
Many of our online interactions are asynchronous, including most social media (Twitter,
Facebook, LinkedIn). Although asynchronous social activity fulfills other social needs, it
does not fulfill our desire and pleasure from synchronous activity.
Because most online interactions don‚Äôt take place with others in physical proximity,

---

## Chunk 813

there are limited opportunities for designers to build in synchronous activity.
Look for opportunities to build synchronous activity into your product, using live video
streaming, or a live video or audio connection.

PEOPLE EXPECT ONLINE
INTERACTIONS TO FOLLOW

There‚Äôs a lot of discussion about social media, but what does the term social media

action. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre sitting outside a caf√© when your friend Mark comes in and sees
you sitting by the window. Mark comes over to you and says, ‚ÄúHi Richard, how are you
doing today?‚Äù Mark expects you to interact with him, and he expects that interaction
to follow a certain protocol. He expects you to look at him, in fact, to look him in the

---

## Chunk 817

eye. If your previous interactions have been positive, then he expects you to smile a
little bit. Next, you‚Äôre supposed to respond to him by saying something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine.
I‚Äôm sitting outside here to enjoy the beautiful weather.‚Äù Where the conversation goes
next depends on how well you know each other. If you‚Äôre casual acquaintances, then

---

## Chunk 818

he might wind down the conversation, ‚ÄúWell, enjoy it while you can. Bye!‚Äù If you‚Äôre close
friends, then he might pull up a chair and engage in a longer conversation.
You both have expectations of how the interaction will go, and if either of you violates
the expectations, then you‚Äôll get uncomfortable. For example, what if Mark starts the

---

## Chunk 819

conversation with ‚ÄúHi, Richard, how are you today?‚Äù but you don‚Äôt respond? What if you
ignore him? Or you won‚Äôt look at him? What if you answered, ‚ÄúMy sister never liked the
color blue‚Äù and stared into space? Or what if you responded with personal information
that was a bit too personal? Any of these scenarios would make Mark uncomfortable. He

---

## Chunk 820

would probably try to end the conversation as quickly as possible, and avoid interacting
with you the next time the opportunity arose.
ONLINE INTERACTIONS HAVE THE SAME RULES
The same is true of online interactions. When you go to a Web site or use an online
application, you have assumptions about how the site will respond to you and what the

interaction will be like. And many of these expectations mirror the expectations that you
have for person-to-person interactions. If the Web site is not responsive or takes too
long to load, it‚Äôs like the person you‚Äôre speaking to is not looking at you, or is ignoring
you. If the site asks for personal information too early in the interaction, that‚Äôs like the

other person getting too personal. If the Web site does not save your information from
session to session, that‚Äôs like the other person not recognizing you or remembering that

from the person‚Äôs hand. He pulls the brochure away and says, ‚ÄúOh, sorry. Before I can

address and your zip code.‚Äù ‚ÄúForget it,‚Äù you respond and walk away. ‚ÄúWait,‚Äù he yells,
‚Äúthat‚Äôs OK, we can skip the email address and zip code.‚Äù But by now you don‚Äôt trust him
and don‚Äôt want to interact.

When you‚Äôre designing a product think, about the interactions that the person will have

PEOPLE LIE TO DIFFERING DEGREES
DEPENDING ON THE MEDIA
There are many ways to communicate: paper and pen, e-mail, face-to-face meetings,
telephone, instant messaging. Some researchers have been interested in whether there
are differences in how honest we are based on the medium.
NINETY-TWO PERCENT OF GRADUATE STUDENTS LIED

---

## Chunk 831

Charles Naquin (2010) from DePaul University and his colleagues have conducted
research on honesty in people when using email versus pen and paper.
In one study, forty-eight graduate business students were each given $89 (imagi-
nary money) to divide with their partner; they had to decide whether to tell their partner

---

## Chunk 832

how much money was in the kitty, as well as how much of the money to share with their
partner. One group communicated by email and the other group by a handwritten note.
The group that wrote emails lied about the amount of money (92 percent) more than the
group that was writing by hand (63 percent). The e-mail group was also less fair about

---

## Chunk 833

sharing the money, and felt justified in not being honest or fair.
MANAGERS LIE, TOO
Lest you think only the students would lie, Naquin and team performed additional stud-
ies with managers. One hundred and seventy-seven managers played a group financial
game. Participants were assigned to teams of three. Each member of the team had a

## Chunk 834

chance to play the role of a manager of a project team who was allocating money for
projects. They played with real money, and they were told that the amount of money
available would be revealed after the game. Some participants were told to communi-
cate via e-mail and others with paper and pen. The managers who communicated via

SPEAKERS‚Äô BRAINS AND
LISTENERS‚Äô BRAINS SYNC UP
DURING COMMUNICATION
When you listen to someone talking, your brain starts working in sync with the speaker.
Greg Stephens (2010) and his team put participants in his research study in an fMRI
machine and had them record or listen to recordings of other people talking. He found

---

## Chunk 847

that as people listen to someone else talk, the brain patterns of both speaker and lis-
tener start to couple, or mirror each other. There‚Äôs a slight delay, which corresponds
to the time it takes for the communication to occur. Several different brain areas were
synced. He compared this with having people listen to someone talk in a language they

---

## Chunk 848

did not understand. In that case the brains do not sync up.
SYNCING PLUS ANTICIPATION EQUALS UNDERSTANDING
In Stephens‚Äôs study, the more the brains were synced up, the more the listener under-
stood the ideas and message from the speaker. And by watching what parts of the brain
were lighting up, Stephens could see that the parts of the brain that have to do with

---

## Chunk 849

prediction and anticipation were active. The more active they were, the more successful
the communication was. Stephens noted that the parts of the brain that have to do with
social interaction were also synced, including areas known to be involved in processing
social information crucial for successful communication, such as the capacity to discern

---

## Chunk 850

the beliefs, desires, and goals of others. Stephens also hypothesizes that mirror neu-
rons are involved in the speaker-listener brain syncing.

LAUGHTER BONDS PEOPLE
TOGETHER
How many times a day do you hear someone laugh? Laughter is so ubiquitous that you
don‚Äôt even stop to think about what it is and why people do it.
There‚Äôs less research on laughter than you might think. But a few people have spent
time researching it. Robert Provine is one of the few neuroscientists studying laughter.

---

## Chunk 863

He has concluded that laughter is an instinctual (not learned) behavior that creates social
bonding.
Provine (2001) has spent many hours observing when and why people laugh. He and
his team observed 1,200 people spontaneously laughing in different locations. They took
notes on gender, situation, speaker, listener, and context. Here‚Äôs a summary of what they
found:

---

## Chunk 864

Laughter is universal. All humans in all cultures laugh.
Laughter is unconscious. People can‚Äôt actually laugh on command‚Äîit will be
fake laughter if they try.
Laughter is for social communication. People rarely laugh when they‚Äôre alone.
They laugh 30 times more often when they‚Äôre with others.
Laughter is contagious. People will smile and then start laughing as they hear
others laugh.

---

## Chunk 865

Laughter appears early in babies at about four months old.
Laughter isn‚Äôt about humor. Provine studied over 2,000 cases of naturally
occurring laughter and most of it did not happen as a result of humor such as
telling jokes. Most laughter followed statements such as ‚ÄúHey John, where ya
been?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHere comes Mary‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow did you do on the test?‚Äù Laughter after

these types of statements bonds people together socially. Only 20 percent of
laughter is from jokes.
People rarely laugh in the middle of a sentence. It‚Äôs usually at the end.

Women laugh more than twice as much as men.

TICKLE LAUGHTER VERSUS JOY LAUGHTER
Diana Szameitat (2010) and her team studied laughter produced from tickling versus

while being tickled versus laughing without tickling. When people listened to regular
laughter without tickling, they showed activity in the medial frontal cortex of the brain.

---

## Chunk 869

This is a region that is usually associated with social and emotional processing. When
people listened to laughter during tickling, they showed activity in the same region, but
also activity in the secondary auditory cortex. Tickle laughter sounds different.

PEOPLE CAN TELL WHEN A SMILE IS
REAL OR FAKE MORE ACCURATELY
WITH VIDEO
Research on smiling started as far back as the mid-1800s. A French doctor named
Guillaume Duchenne used electrical currents with research subjects. He would stimu-
late certain facial muscles and then take pictures of the expressions that people made

---

## Chunk 875

(Figure 71.1). This was painful and many of the pictures look like the people are in pain.
FIGURE 71.1 Guillaume Duchenne took photos of people
whose facial muscles were electrically stimulated
REAL OR FAKE?
Duchenne identified two different types of smiles. Some smiles involve contraction of
both the zygomatic major muscle (which raises the corners of the mouth) and the orbi-

---

## Chunk 876

cularis oculi muscle (which raises the cheeks and makes the eyes crinkle). Smiles that
contract both of these muscle groups are called Duchenne smiles. In a non-Duchenne
smile only the zygomatic major muscle contracts; in other words, the mouth turns up,
but the eyes don‚Äôt crinkle.

## Chunk 877

--- Page 175 ---
After Duchenne, several researchers used these ideas to research smiling. For years
it was believed that Duchenne smiles were the ones that were seen as genuine, that
it was not possible to ‚Äúfake‚Äù a smile, because up to 80 percent of people can‚Äôt con-
sciously control the muscles around the eyes that make them crinkle. Why all the inter-

---

## Chunk 878

est in whether a smile is real or fake? Because people are quicker to trust and like other
people who are showing what are believed to be genuine emotions rather than fake or
contrived ones.
QUESTIONING THE 80 PERCENT FIGURE
Eva Krumhuber and Antony Manstead (2009) decided to research whether it was true
that most people couldn‚Äôt create a fake smile that looks real. They found the opposite of

---

## Chunk 879

what was previously believed. In their research, when photos were taken of people pre-
tending to smile, 83 percent of the people could produce fake smiles that other people
thought were real.
They also decided to test videos rather than just photos. What they found was that it
was harder to fake a smile in a video, but not because of the crinkly eyes. People could

---

## Chunk 880

tell real from fake by paying attention to other factors, such as how long they held the
smile, and whether they saw other emotions besides happiness, for example, a flicker of
impatience. The video made it easier to detect a fake smile because it lasted longer and
was dynamic, instead of just a snapshot.
Takeaways

---

## Chunk 881

Pay attention to smiles in videos. People will be able to determine a fake smile versus
a real one better in a video than in a photo. If they don‚Äôt think the smile is real, they‚Äôre
less likely to trust you.
It is possible to fake a smile and to fake a crinkly-eye smile, but it is easier to fake a
smile in a static picture than on a video.

---

## Chunk 882

People can tell whether a smile is real or not by looking for conflicting emotions. They
are looking at many parts of the face, not just the eyes.
If a smile looks real, it will engage the viewer and build trust.

SEVEN BASIC EMOTIONS
ARE UNIVERSAL
Considering how important emotions are in our everyday life, there‚Äôs not as much
research on them as you might think. Scientists studying emotions distinguish them
from moods and attitudes:
Emotions have physiological correlates, are expressed physically (through

---

## Chunk 885

gestures, facial expressions, and so on), result from a specific event, and often
lead to an action.
Moods last longer than emotions, perhaps a day or two. They may not be
expressed physically, and may not come from a specific event.
Attitudes have a more cognitive, conscious brain component.
Joseph LeDoux (2000) has shown that certain parts of the brain activate when

---

## Chunk 886

people are feeling certain emotions.
FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ARE UNIVERSAL; GESTURES ARE NOT

EMOTIONS ARE TIED TO MUSCLE
MOVEMENT AND VICE VERSA
Botox is a popular cosmetic product used to reduce facial wrinkles. It‚Äôs injected into var-
ious muscles (for instance, in the face) and paralyzes them, thereby causing the wrinkles
to relax. It‚Äôs been known for some time that a side effect of Botox treatments is that peo-

---

## Chunk 894

ple can‚Äôt fully express emotions (for example, they can‚Äôt move the muscles that show
they‚Äôre angry or even happy). New research shows that another side effect of the injec-
tions is that people can‚Äôt feel emotions as well, either. If you can‚Äôt move your muscles to
make a facial expression, you can‚Äôt feel the emotion that goes with the expression. So if

---

## Chunk 895

you‚Äôve recently received a Botox injection and you go to a movie that is sad, you won‚Äôt
feel sad because you won‚Äôt be able to move the muscles in your face that go with feel-
ing sad. Moving muscles and feeling emotions are linked.
Joshua Davis (2010) from Barnard College and his team tested this idea with some

## Chunk 896

research. They injected people with either Botox or Restylane. Restylane is a substance
that, when injected, fills out sagging skin, but does not limit muscle movement like Botox
does. Before and after injecting the participants, they showed them emotionally charged
videos. The Botox group showed much less emotional reaction to the videos after the
injections.

David Havas (2010) gave people instructions to contract the specific muscles used in

frown, the participants had a hard time feeling friendly or happy.

You may need to consider the emotions you‚Äôre generating as people interact with your

ANECDOTES PERSUADE MORE
THAN DATA
In my book Neuro Web Design: What Makes Them Click? I explain that most mental pro-
cessing occurs unconsciously. People are unaware of this unconscious processing, so
it‚Äôs easy to give more weight to information that we‚Äôre consciously aware of. It‚Äôs easy to
forget that information is coming in and being processed from many sources. It‚Äôs easy

---

## Chunk 906

to forget that you are processing emotions, too.
Let‚Äôs say you have to make a presentation to the department heads at work about
your latest conversations with your customers. You interviewed 25 customers and sur-
veyed another 100, and have lots of important data to share. Your first thought might be to
present a summary of the data in a numerical/statistical/data driven format, for example:

---

## Chunk 907

75 percent of the customers we interviewed‚Ä¶
Only 15 percent of the customers responding to the survey indicated‚Ä¶
But this data-based approach will be less persuasive than anecdotes. You may want
to include the data, but your presentation will be more powerful if you focus on one or
more anecdotes, for example, ‚ÄúMary M. from San Francisco shared the following story

---

## Chunk 908

about how she uses our product‚Ä¶,‚Äù and then go on to tell Mary‚Äôs story.
One of the reasons why anecdotes are more powerful than data is that anecdotes are
in story form. They invoke empathy, which triggers an emotional reaction. With emotional
reactions, people will process the data and the feelings. Emotions will also trigger the
memory centers.

---

## Chunk 909

Better yet, don‚Äôt just tell Mary‚Äôs story in the presentation‚Äîinclude a video of Mary telling
the story herself. That makes an even more powerful emotional connection. (See the ‚ÄúPeo-
ple Are Social Animals‚Äù chapter for more information on why video is a powerful medium.)
Takeaways
Information is processed more deeply and remembered longer if it has an emotional
hook.

---

## Chunk 910

Look for ways to provide a message that will invoke emotions and empathy.
Use anecdotes in addition to, or in place of, factual data.

SMELLS EVOKE EMOTIONS
AND MEMORIES
Do you have a type of food that evokes an emotional reaction when you smell it? For
me it‚Äôs kasha. Kasha is a form of buckwheat. The buckwheat kernels come roasted, and
you cook them in oil and then boil them with salt, pepper, onion, and garlic. I‚Äôve met
very few people who have actually eaten kasha, much less know what kasha is.

---

## Chunk 912

When I smell kasha cooking, I get a big smile on my face and I feel happy. This is
because my mother used to cook kasha. I have a positive emotional memory of her
when I smell kasha cooking.
THE SPECIAL OLFACTORY PATH
The thalamus is the part of the brain between the cerebral cortex and the midbrain. One
of its functions is to process sensory information and send it to the appropriate part of the

---

## Chunk 913

cortex. For example, visual information comes from the retina, goes to the thalamus, and
then gets routed to the primary visual cortex. All of the senses send their data to the thala-
mus before the information goes anywhere else, with the exception of smell. The olfac-
tory system does not go through the thalamus. When you smell something, that sensory

---

## Chunk 914

data goes right to your amygdala, where emotional information is processed. This is why
people react emotionally to smells. You smell a flower and it makes you happy. You smell
rotten meat and it makes you feel disgusted. The amygdala is right next to the memory
centers of the brain. This is also why smelling something invokes memories.

the unconscious, old brain is looking for anything new or novel.
CRAVING THE UNEXPECTED

## Chunk 924

Research by Gregory Berns (2001) shows that the human brain not only looks for the
unexpected, it actually craves the unexpected.
Berns used a computer-controlled device to squirt either water or fruit juice into
people‚Äôs mouths while their brains were being scanned by an fMRI device. Sometimes
the participants could predict when they were going to get a squirt, but other times it

## Chunk 925

was unpredictable. The researchers thought that they would see activity based on what
people liked. For example, if a participant liked juice then there would be activity in the
nucleus accumbens, the part of the brain that is active when people experience pleasur-
able events.
However, that‚Äôs not what happened. The nucleus accumbens was most active when

Consider this scenario: You‚Äôve just landed at an airport and you have to walk to the bag-

arrive your luggage is coming onto the carousel. How impatient do you feel?
Contrast that with this scenario: You‚Äôve just landed at an airport, and the walk to the

luggage carousel takes 2 minutes. Then you stand around waiting 10 minutes for your
luggage to appear. How impatient do you feel now?
In both cases it took you 12 minutes to pick up your luggage, but chances are you are
much more impatient, and much unhappier, in the second scenario where you have to
stand around and wait.
PEOPLE NEED AN EXCUSE

---

## Chunk 935

Research by Christopher Hsee (2010) and his colleagues shows that people are hap-
pier when they‚Äôre busy. This is somewhat of a paradox. In the ‚ÄúWhat Motivates People‚Äù
chapter, I wrote that we are lazy. Unless people have a reason for being active, they‚Äôll
choose to do nothing, thereby conserving energy. However, doing nothing makes peo-
ple impatient and unhappy.

---

## Chunk 936

Hsee‚Äôs team gave participants a choice between delivering a completed question-
naire to a location that was a 15-minute, round-trip walk away, or delivering it just outside
the room and then waiting 15 minutes. Some participants were offered the same snack
bar regardless of which activity they chose, and others were offered a different type of

---

## Chunk 937

snack bar for the two options. (Hsee previously determined that both snack bars were
considered equally desirable.)
If the same snack bar was offered at both locations, then most (68 percent) of the
participants chose to deliver the questionnaire just outside the room (the ‚Äúlazy‚Äù option).
The students‚Äô first reaction was to do less work, but when they were given an excuse for

---

## Chunk 938

walking further, most of them took the busy option. After the experiment, the students
who‚Äôd taken the walk reported feeling significantly happier than the idle students. In a
second version of the study, the students were assigned to either the ‚Äúbusy‚Äù or the ‚Äúidle‚Äù
option (in other words, they did not choose). The busier students, again, reported higher
happiness scores.

---

## Chunk 939

In the next round of research, Hsee asked students to study a bracelet. Then he gave
them the option of either spending 15 minutes waiting with nothing to do (they thought
they were waiting for the next part of the experiment), or spending the same time tak-
ing the bracelet apart and then rebuilding it while waiting. Some of the participants were

## Chunk 940

given the option of rebuilding it into its original configuration, and others were given the
option to reassemble the bracelet into a different design.
Participants who had the option of rebuilding the bracelet as it was before preferred
to just sit idly. But the participants who were told they could reassemble the bracelet into

---

## Chunk 941

a new design preferred to work on the bracelet rather than sit idle. As before, those who
spent the 15 minutes busy with the bracelet reported feeling happier than those who
sat idle.
Takeaways
People don‚Äôt like to be idle.
People will do a task rather than be idle, but the task has to be seen as worthwhile. If
people perceive it to be busywork, then they prefer to stay idle.

People who are busy are happier.

for them to do while waiting.

According to Denis Dutton, a philosopher and the author of The Art Instinct: Beauty,

that, some participants were asked to walk through downtown Ann Arbor, Michigan, and

wide lawns (that is, it‚Äôs a pastoral environment). Following the walk, the participants did
the backward digit-span task again. Scores were higher for the people who had walked

Roger Ulrich (1984) found that patients whose hospital window overlooked scenes of

patients whose rooms looked onto a brick wall.

Peter Kahn (2009) and his team, tested nature scenes in the workplace. One group
of participants worked in an office where they sat near a glass window that overlooked
a nature scene. A second group saw a similar scene, but not out the window; instead,
they watched a video feed from a nature area outside. A third group sat near an empty

wall. The researchers kept measurements of the participants‚Äô heart rates to monitor their
stress levels.
People who saw the video scene said that they felt better, but their heart rates were
actually no different from those who sat next to the wall. People in front of the glass win-
dow actually had healthier heart rate measurements, and were better able to recover
from stress.
Takeaways

People like pastoral scenes. If you‚Äôre looking for a nature scene to use at a Web site,
try to pick one with the pastoral elements.
People will be drawn to, like, and feel happier looking at a pastoral scene online, but it
won‚Äôt have the same positive health effects as seeing the actual scene out a window
or being able to walk through the pastoral setting.

When participants in the study rejected a health Web site as not being trustworthy,

Web site.
When participants mentioned the features that were relevant to their decision that

LISTENING TO MUSIC RELEASES
DOPAMINE IN THE BRAIN
Have you ever listened to a piece of music and experienced intense pleasure, even
chills? Valorie Salimpoor (2011) and her team conducted research that shows that listen-
ing to music can release the neurotransmitter dopamine. Even anticipating music can
release dopamine.

---

## Chunk 968

The researchers used Positron Emission Tomography scans, fMRI, and psychophysio-
logical measures such as heart rate to measure reactions while people listened to music.
The participants provided music that they said gave them intense pleasure and chills.
The range of music included classical, folk, jazz, electronica, rock, pop, tango, and more.
PLEASURE VERSUS ANTICIPATED PLEASURE

---

## Chunk 969

Salimpoor‚Äôs team saw the same pattern of brain and body activity when people were
listening to their music that they saw when people feel euphoria and craving while get-
ting a reward. The experience of pleasure corresponded with dopamine release in one
part of the brain (the striatal dopaminergic system). When people were anticipating a

---

## Chunk 970

pleasurable part of the music, there was a dopamine release in a different part of the
brain (the nucleus accumbens).
Takeaways
Music can be intensely pleasurable.
People have favorite music that induces euphoria.
Music is very individualized. What induces euphoria in one person may have no effect
for someone else.

---

## Chunk 971

Anticipating the pleasurable parts of music activates different areas of the brain and
neurotransmitters than actually listening to and experiencing the music.
Allowing people to use or add their own music to whatever Web site, product, design,
or activity they‚Äôre engaging in is a powerful way to engage them in a positive and
potentially addictive experience.

THE MORE DIFFICULT SOMETHING IS
TO ACHIEVE, THE MORE PEOPLE LIKE IT
You‚Äôve heard about fraternities that have difficult initiation rituals to get in. The idea is
that if an organization is hard to get into, then the people in it like it even more than if
entry was not so difficult.
The first research on this initiation effect was done by Elliot Aronson at Stanford Univer-

---

## Chunk 974

sity in 1959. Aronson set up three initiation scenarios (severe, medium, and mild, although
the severe was not really that severe) and randomly assigned people to the conditions. He
did indeed find that the more difficult the initiation, the more people liked the group.
COGNITIVE DISSONANCE THEORY
Leon Festinger (1956) was the social psychologist who developed the idea of cognitive dis-

---

## Chunk 975

sonance theory. Aronson uses this theory to explain why people like groups that they had to
endure hardship to join. People go through this painful experience only to find themselves
part of a group that is not all that exciting or interesting. But that sets up a conflict (disso-
nance) in their thought process‚Äîif it‚Äôs boring and uninteresting, why did I submit myself

---

## Chunk 976

to pain and hardship? To reduce the dissonance then, you decide that the group is really
important and worthwhile. Then it makes sense that you were willing to go through the pain.
SCARCITY AND EXCLUSIVITY
In addition to the theory of cognitive dissonance to explain this phenomenon, I think
scarcity comes into play. If it‚Äôs difficult to join the group, then not very many people can

---

## Chunk 977

do it. If I might not be able to make it in, then I would lose out. So if I went through a lot
of pain, it must be good.
Takeaways
I‚Äôm not suggesting that you make your Web site, product, or software application hard
to use so that people will feel pain and therefore like it more, although that is probably
accurate.

---

## Chunk 978

If you want people to join your online community, you might find that people use it more
and value it more if there are steps that have to be taken to join. Filling out an application,
meeting certain criteria, being invited by others‚Äîall of these can be seen as barriers to
entry, but they may also mean that the people who do join care more about the group.

PEOPLE OVERESTIMATE REACTIONS
TO FUTURE EVENTS
Here‚Äôs a thought experiment. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being
the highest, rate how happy you are right now. Write that number down. Now imagine
that you win the lottery today. You now have more money than you ever thought you

---

## Chunk 980

would. You have millions and millions of dollars. What do you think your happiness rat-
ing would be at the end of today? Write that number down. What do you think your hap-
piness rating will be two years from now, if you win millions and millions in the lottery
today?
PEOPLE ARE POOR PREDICTORS
In his book, Stumbling on Happiness (2007), Daniel Gilbert discusses the research he

---

## Chunk 981

and others have conducted on predicting or estimating emotional reactions to events.
He has found that people greatly overestimate their own reactions to both pleasant and
unpleasant events in their lives. Whether it‚Äôs predicting how they‚Äôll respond to a nega-
tive event (such as losing a job, having an accident, or the death of a loved one) or a

---

## Chunk 982

positive one (such as coming into a lot of money, landing a dream job, or finding the per-
fect mate), everyone tends to overestimate their reaction. If the event is negative, they
predict that they‚Äôll be very upset and devastated for a long time. If the event is positive,
they predict that they‚Äôll be deliriously happy for a long time.
A BUILT-IN REGULATOR

---

## Chunk 983

What really happens is that you have a built-in regulator. Whether negative events hap-
pen, or positive events happen, you stay at about the same level of happiness most of
the time. Some people are generally happier or less happy than others, and this level of
happiness stays constant no matter what happens to them. This means that people are

---

## Chunk 984

not very accurate in their predictions of future happiness.
Takeaways
Be careful of believing customers who tell you that making a particular change to a prod-
uct or a design will make them much happier with it, or cause them to never use it again.
People may prefer one thing over another or think that they will, but their reaction, be it

PEOPLE FEEL MORE POSITIVE
BEFORE AND AFTER AN EVENT
THAN DURING IT
Imagine you‚Äôre planning a trip with your sister to the Cayman Islands several months
from now. The two of you talk on the phone at least once a week, discuss the snorkel-
ing you plan to do, and talk about restaurants that are close to the place you are stay-
ing. You look forward to the trip for a long time.

---

## Chunk 987

Contrast that with the actual experience of the trip and you may find that the antici-
pation was better than the trip. In fact, Terence Mitchell (1997) and his team conducted
research on just such a situation. They studied people who were taking a trip to Europe,
a short trip over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, or a three-week bicycle tour of
California.

---

## Chunk 988

Before the event people looked forward to the trip with positive emotions, but dur-
ing the trip their ratings of the trip were not that positive. The little disappointments that
always occur while traveling colored their emotional landscape to the point where they
felt less positive about the trip in general. Interestingly, a few days after the trip, the
memories became rosy again.

PEOPLE WANT WHAT IS FAMILIAR
WHEN THEY‚ÄôRE SAD OR SCARED
It‚Äôs Friday afternoon and your boss calls you in to say that he‚Äôs not happy with your lat-
est project report. This is the project that you repeatedly told him was in trouble and
you asked that more staff be assigned. You feel all your warnings were ignored. Now

## Chunk 996

he‚Äôs telling you that this work will reflect badly on you and you may even lose your job.
On the way home you stop at the grocery store. You are sad and scared. Will you buy
the cereal you always buy, or will you try something new?
PEOPLE WANT WHAT‚ÄôS FAMILIAR
According to research by Marieke De Vries (2010) of Radboud University Nijmegen, in

---

## Chunk 997

the Netherlands, you will buy the familiar brand. Research shows that people want what
is familiar when they are sad or scared. They are willing to try something new and differ-
ent when they‚Äôre in a happy mood and not as sensitive to what is familiar.
THE DESIRE FOR THE FAMILIAR IS RELATED TO THE FEAR OF LOSS

---

## Chunk 998

This craving for the familiar and a preference for familiar brands is probably tied to the
basic fear of loss. In my book Neuro Web Design: What Makes Them Click? I talk about
the fear of loss. When people are sad or scared, the old brain and the mid-brain (emo-
tional) are on alert. They have to protect themselves. And a quick way to be safe is to go

with what you know. A strong brand is familiar. A strong logo is familiar. So when people
are sad or scared, they‚Äôll go for a brand and logo they know.

Takeaways
Brands are a shortcut. If someone has had a positive experience with a brand in the
past, then that brand is a signal of safety to the old brain.
Brands are just as important, or even more important, online. In the absence of being
able to see and touch the actual product, the brand becomes the surrogate for the

---

## Chunk 1004

experience. This means that brands have a lot of power when people are making an
online purchase.
Messages of fear or loss may be more persuasive if your brand is an established one.
Messages of fun and happiness may be more persuasive if your brand is a new one.

MISTAKES; THERE IS NO FAIL-SAFE

I collect computer error messages. It‚Äôs kind of a hobby. Some of them date back to the
old character-based computer screens. Most of them weren‚Äôt trying to be humorous;
they were written by computer programmers who were trying to explain what was going

wrong. But many of them end up being quite funny, and some of them intentionally so.
My favorite was from a company in Texas. When there was a ‚Äúfatal‚Äù error, meaning the
system was going to crash, a message came up that said, ‚ÄúShut ‚Äòer down Henry, she‚Äôs
spewin‚Äô up mud!‚Äù
ASSUME THAT SOMETHING WILL GO WRONG
The reality is that something always goes wrong: a user makes a mistake in work-

---

## Chunk 1008

ing with a computer, or a company releases software that has too many errors, or a
designer develops something that is unusable because he or she doesn‚Äôt understand
what the user needs to do. Everyone makes mistakes.
It is very difficult to create a system that is free of all errors, and that guarantees that
people won‚Äôt make mistakes. In fact it‚Äôs impossible. Ask the people at Three Mile Island,

---

## Chunk 1009

or Chernobyl, or British Petroleum. The more costly the errors are, the more you need
to avoid them. The more you need to avoid them, the more expensive it is to design the
system. If it‚Äôs critical that people not make mistakes (for example, if you‚Äôre designing a
nuclear power plant, or an oil rig, or a medical device), then be prepared. You‚Äôll have to

## Chunk 1010

test two or three times more than usual, and you‚Äôll have to train two or three times lon-
ger. It‚Äôs expensive to design a fail-safe system. And you will never fully succeed.

Error messages are probably the part of a device or software program that gets the
least amount of time and energy, and maybe that is appropriate. After all, the best error

message is no error message (meaning that the system is designed so that no one

How to write an error message
Assuming that an error will occur and that you‚Äôll need to inform the person using your
design, make sure that your error message does the following:
Tells the person what he or she did
Explains the problem
Instructs the person how to correct it
Is written in plain language using active, not passive, voice
Shows an example

---

## Chunk 1013

Here is an example of a poor error message:
#402: Before the invoice can be paid it is necessary that the invoice payment be
later than the invoice create date.
Say instead, ‚ÄúYou entered an invoice payment date that is earlier than the invoice
create date. Check the dates and reenter so that the invoice payment date is after the
invoice create date.‚Äù
Takeaways

---

## Chunk 1014

Think ahead to what the likely mistakes will be. Figure out as much as you can about
the kinds of mistakes people are going to make when they use what you‚Äôve designed.
And then change your design before it goes out so that those mistakes won‚Äôt be made.
Create a prototype of your design and get people to use it so you can see what the

---

## Chunk 1015

errors are likely to be. When you do this, make sure the people who are testing the
prototype are the same people who will be using it. For example, if the product is
designed for nurses in a hospital, don‚Äôt use your designers down the hall to test for
errors. You need to have nurses at a hospital test for errors.

I was traveling, I was ‚Äúout of network,‚Äù so I first had to call my insurance provider to find

THE YERKES-DODSON LAW

---

## Chunk 1023

Research on stress shows that a little stress (called arousal in the field of psychology)
can help you perform a task, because it heightens awareness. Too much stress, how-
ever, degrades performance. Two psychologists, Robert Yerkes and John Dodson,
(1908) first postulated this arousal/performance relationship, and hence it has been
called the Yerkes-Dodson law for over a century (Figure 86.2).

FIGURE 86.2 The Yerkes-Dodson law
Arousal helps up to a point
The Yerkes-Dodson law states that performance increases with physiological or mental
arousal, but only up to a point. When levels of arousal become too high, performance
decreases. Research shows that the optimal amount of stress/arousal depends on the

## Chunk 1025

difficulty of the task. Difficult tasks require less arousal to reach optimal performance,
and will start to break down if the arousal level is too high. Simpler tasks require more
arousal and don‚Äôt fall off as fast.

Tunnel action sets in
When arousal first goes up there is an energizing effect, as the person is paying atten-
tion. But as the stress increases there are negative effects. Attention gets unfocused,
people have trouble remembering, problem solving degrades, and tunnel action sets in.
Tunnel action is where you keep doing the same task over and over, even though it isn‚Äôt
working.

Takeaways
If people are performing a boring task, then you need to raise the level of arousal with
sound, colors, or movement.
If people are doing a difficult task, then you need to lower the level of arousal by

---

## Chunk 1039

eliminating any distracting elements such as color, sounds, or movement, unless they
are directly related to the task at hand.
If people are under stress, they won‚Äôt see things on the screen, and they‚Äôll tend to do
the same actions over and over, even if they don‚Äôt work.
Do research to find out which situations might be stressful. Make site visits, observe

---

## Chunk 1040

and interview the people who are using your product, determine the level of stress,
and then redesign if stress is present.
If someone is an expert at a well-learned task, then performance stress may cause
errors.

NOT ALL MISTAKES ARE BAD
Dimitri van der Linden (2001) and his team conducted research on exploration strategies
that people employ when learning how to use computers and electronic devices. Van
der Linden‚Äôs idea is that errors have consequences, but, contrary to popular belief, not
all consequences are negative. Although it‚Äôs possible, and even likely, that making an

---

## Chunk 1042

error has a negative consequence, it‚Äôs also likely that the error has a positive or a neu-
tral outcome.
Errors with a positive consequence are actions that do not give the desired result,
but provide the person with information that helps him or her achieve an overall goal.
Errors with a negative consequence are those that result in a dead end, undo a posi-

---

## Chunk 1043

tive consequence, send the person back to a starting point, or result in action that can-
not be reversed.
Errors with a neutral consequence are errors that have no effect on task completion.
For example, let‚Äôs say that you‚Äôve designed a new tablet to compete with the iPad. You
give people an early prototype to see how usable the device is. They move the slider bar

---

## Chunk 1044

that they think is the volume control, but instead the screen gets brighter. They‚Äôve chosen
the brightness slider, rather than the volume slider. It‚Äôs a mistake, but now they know how
to make the screen brighter. If that‚Äôs a feature that they also need to learn to accomplish
the task of watching a video (and assuming they do eventually find the volume slider),

---

## Chunk 1045

then we could say that the error had a positive consequence.
Now let‚Äôs say that they‚Äôre trying to move a file from one folder to another, but they
misunderstand the meaning of the button choices and they delete the file instead. That‚Äôs
an error that has negative consequences.
Finally, they try to select a menu option that is not available. They‚Äôve made an error,

---

## Chunk 1046

but the consequence is neither positive nor negative‚Äîit‚Äôs neutral.
Takeaways
Although you don‚Äôt want people to make lots of errors when using your product, errors
will occur.
Since you know there will be errors, look for and document them during user testing.
Note whether each error consequence is positive, negative, or neutral.

---

## Chunk 1047

After user testing (and even before it), concentrate on redesigning to minimize or avoid
errors with negative consequences first.

PEOPLE MAKE PREDICTABLE TYPES
OF ERRORS
In addition to thinking about the consequences of errors, as in the van der Linden study
described previously, there is another useful error taxonomy. The Morrell (2000) tax-
onomy classifies two types of errors: performance and motor-control.
PERFORMANCE ERRORS

---

## Chunk 1049

Performance errors are mistakes you make while you‚Äôre going through the steps to
complete a procedure. Morrell further divides performance errors into commission
errors, omission errors, or wrong-action errors.
Commission errors
Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre trying to get a task done, such as turning on the Wi-Fi on your tablet.

---

## Chunk 1050

All you have to do is touch the On/Off control on the screen, but you think that you also
need to touch the drop-down menu and select the network. That‚Äôs an example of a
commission error: you took additional steps that were unnecessary.
Omission errors
Now let‚Äôs say that you‚Äôre setting up e-mail on your new tablet. You enter your e-mail

---

## Chunk 1051

address and password. What you don‚Äôt realize is that you have to set up your outgoing
and incoming mail settings; you‚Äôve only set up the outgoing ones. In this case you omit-
ted steps; this is called an omission error.
Wrong-action errors
Let‚Äôs go back to setting up email. You enter your email and address, but you enter the

---

## Chunk 1052

wrong server name for your email outgoing server. That is an example of a wrong-action
error. You took an action at the appropriate point in the procedure, but it was the wrong
action.
MOTOR-CONTROL ERRORS
Motor-control errors are those you make while using the controls of a device. Let‚Äôs say
you‚Äôre trying to get used to using your fingers to rotate a picture on your tablet. But

---

## Chunk 1053

8888 PEOPLE MAKE PREDICTABLETYPESOFERRORS 195

---

## Chunk 1054

--- Page 209 ---
instead of rotating the picture, you go to the next picture. In this case you‚Äôve made a
motor-control error.
You may have different errors that you want to track as you design or conduct user
testing. The important thing is to decide ahead of time which types of errors you think
people will make, and which are important for you to detect and correct.

The Swiss cheese model of human error
In his book Human Error (1990), James Reason wrote that errors have a cumulative
effect. Figure 88.1 starts with an error in the organization, which then leads to additional
errors in supervision, which leads to even more errors. Each error makes a hole in the
system until the end when you have Swiss cheese (lots of holes), eventually leading to a

## Chunk 1059

People will make different types of errors in learning about and using your product.
Before you conduct user testing or user observation, decide on the possible errors
you are most concerned about.
During user testing and observation, collect data on which category of errors people
are making. This will help focus your redesign efforts after testing.

## Chunk 1060

If you‚Äôre in a field where errors are not just annoying or inefficient, but actually may
result in accidents or loss of human lives, then you should use a system like HFACS
to analyze and prevent errors.

PEOPLE USE DIFFERENT ERROR
STRATEGIES
In addition to classifying the types of errors that people make, you can think about
the types of strategies that people use to correct an error. Neung Eun Kang and Wan
Chul Yoon (2008) conducted a research study to look at the types of errors that both
younger and older adults make when learning how to use new technologies. In their

---

## Chunk 1062

study they identified and tracked different error strategies.
SYSTEMATIC EXPLORATIONS
When people use systematic exploration, this means that they plan out what proce-
dures they‚Äôll use to correct the error. For example, let‚Äôs say that they‚Äôre trying to figure
out how to put a song on a repeat loop on their tablet. They try one menu and that

---

## Chunk 1063

doesn‚Äôt work, so they set out to see what each item in the menu system does for the
music part of the device. They start at the first item in the first menu and works their way
through all the choices in the part of the tablet controls related to playing music. They
are exploring systematically.
TRIAL AND ERROR EXPLORATIONS

---

## Chunk 1064

In contrast to systematic exploration, trial and error means that the person randomly
tries out different actions, menus, icons, and controls.
RIGID EXPLORATIONS
Doing the same action over and over, even though it doesn‚Äôt solve the error, is
called rigid exploration. For example, let‚Äôs say someone wants a song to repeat in

---

## Chunk 1065

a loop on their tablet and touches an icon on the screen that they think should set
the song to loop. But it doesn‚Äôt work. They then choose the song again, and press
the icon again. And they keep repeating this combination of actions, even though
it doesn‚Äôt work.

PEOPLE MAKE MOST DECISIONS
UNCONSCIOUSLY
You‚Äôre thinking of buying a TV. You do some research on what TV to buy and then go
online to purchase one. What factors are involved in this decision-making process?
It may not be the process you think it is. In my book Neuro Web Design: What Makes

---

## Chunk 1077

Them Click?I explain that people like to think that they‚Äôve carefully and logically weighed
all the relevant factors before they make a decision. In the case of the TV, you‚Äôve consid-
ered the size of TV that works best in your room, the brand that you‚Äôve read is the most
reliable, the competitive price, whether this is the best time to buy, and so on. You‚Äôve

---

## Chunk 1078

considered all those factors consciously, but research on decision making shows that
your actual decision is made primarily in an unconscious way.
Unconscious decision making includes factors such as
What other people are deciding to buy: ‚ÄúI see that a particular TV got high rat-
ings and reviews at the Web site.‚Äù
What is consistent with your persona (commitment): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the kind of person

---

## Chunk 1079

who always has the latest thing, the newest technology.‚Äù
Whether you can pay off any obligations or social debts with this purchase
(reciprocity): ‚ÄúMy brother has had me over to his house all year to watch the
games. I think it‚Äôs time we had them over to our place to watch, so I‚Äôd better
get a TV at least as good as his.‚Äù

Fear of loss: ‚ÄúThis TV is on sale, and if I don‚Äôt buy it right now the price may go
up and I might not be able to buy one for a long time.‚Äù
Your particular drives, motivations, and fears.
UNCONSCIOUS DOESN‚ÄôT MEAN IRRATIONAL OR BAD
Most of our mental processing is unconscious, and most of our decision making is
unconscious, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs faulty, irrational, or bad. We‚Äôre faced with an

## Chunk 1081

overwhelming amount of data (millions of pieces of data come into the brain every sec-
ond!) and our conscious minds can‚Äôt process all of it. The unconscious has evolved to
process most of the data and to make decisions for us according to guidelines and rules
of thumb that are in our best interest most of the time. This is the genesis of ‚Äútrusting
your gut,‚Äù and most of the time it works.

Takeaways
To design a product or Web site that persuades people to take a certain action, you
need to know the unconscious motivations of your target audience.
When people tell you their reasons for deciding to take a certain action, you have to be
skeptical about what they say. Because decision making is unconscious, they may be
unaware of the true reasons for their decisions.

---

## Chunk 1084

Even though people make decisions based on unconscious factors, they want a
rational, logical reason for the decisions they make. So you still need to provide
the rational, logical reasons, even though they‚Äôre unlikely to be the actual reasons
that people decided to take action.

THE UNCONSCIOUS KNOWS FIRST
One of my favorite pieces of research on unconscious mental processing was con-
ducted by Antoine Bechara (1997) and his team. Participants in the study played a gam-
bling game with decks of cards. Each person received $2,000 of pretend money. They
were told that the goal was to lose as little of the $2,000 as possible, and to try to make

---

## Chunk 1086

as much over the $2,000 as possible. There were four decks of cards on the table. Each
participant turned over a card from any of the four decks, one card at a time, and con-
tinued turning over cards from the deck of their choice until the experimenter told them
to stop. The subjects didn‚Äôt know when the game would end. They were told that they

---

## Chunk 1087

earned money every time they turned over a card. They were also told that sometimes
when they turned over a card, they earned money but also lost money (by paying it to
the experimenter). The participants didn‚Äôt know any of the rules of the gambling game.
Here are what the rules actually were:
If they turned over any card in decks A or B, they earned $100. If they turned

---

## Chunk 1088

over any card in decks C and D, they earned $50.
Some cards in decks A and B also required participants to pay the experi-
menter a lot of money, sometimes as much as $1,250. Some cards in decks C
and D also required participants to pay the experimenter, but the amount they
had to pay was only an average of $100.
Over the course of the game, decks A and B produced net losses if partici-

---

## Chunk 1089

pants continued using them. Continued use of decks C and D rewarded par-
ticipants with net gains.
The rules never changed. Although participants didn‚Äôt know this, the game ended
after 100 cards had been turned over.
THE UNCONSCIOUS MIND PICKS UP THE DANGER FIRST
Most participants started by trying all four decks. At first, they gravitated toward decks

---

## Chunk 1090

A and B because those decks paid out $100 per turn. But after about 30 turns, most
turned to decks C and D. They then continued turning cards in decks C and D until the
game ended. During the study, the experimenter stopped the game several times to
ask participants about the decks. The participants were connected to a skin conduc-

---

## Chunk 1091

tance sensor to measure their skin conductance response (SCR). The participants‚Äô SCR
readings were elevated when they played decks A and B (the ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù decks) long
before they consciously realized that A and B were dangerous. Their SCRs increased
204 HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

---

## Chunk 1092

--- Page 218 ---
before they touched‚Äîor even thought about‚Äîusing decks A and B. The unconscious
knew that decks A and B were ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù and resulted in a loss. This was evidenced
by the spike in the SCR. However, that‚Äôs all unconscious. Their conscious minds didn‚Äôt
yet know that anything was wrong.
Eventually participants said they had a hunch that decks C and D were better, but the

---

## Chunk 1093

SCR shows that the old brain figured this out long before the new brain realized it. By the
end of the game, most participants had more than a hunch and could articulate the differ-
ence in the two decks, but a full 30 percent of the participants couldn‚Äôt explain why they
preferred decks C and D. They said they just thought those decks were better.
Takeaways

---

## Chunk 1094

People respond and react to unconscious signals of danger.
The unconscious acts more quickly than the conscious mind. This means that people
often take actions or have preferences, but cannot explain why they prefer what
they do.

PEOPLE WANT MORE CHOICES
AND INFORMATION THAN THEY
CAN PROCESS
If you stand in any aisle in any retail store in the U.S., you‚Äôll be inundated with choices.
Whether you‚Äôre buying candy, cereal, TVs, or jeans, you‚Äôll likely have a huge number of
items to choose from. Whether it‚Äôs a retail store or a Web site, if you ask people if they‚Äôd

prefer to choose from a few alternatives or have lots of choices, most people will say
they want lots of choices.
TOO MANY CHOICES PARALYZES THE THOUGHT PROCESS
Sheena Iyengar‚Äôs book The Art of Choosing (2010)details her research and others‚Äô on
choice. In graduate school Iyengar conducted what is now known as the ‚Äújam‚Äù study.

---

## Chunk 1097

Iyengar and Mark Lepper (2000) decided to test the theory that people who have too
many choices will not choose at all. They set up booths at a busy upscale grocery store
and posed as store employees. They alternated the selection on the table. Half of the
time there were six choices of fruit jam for people to try and the other half of the time
there were twenty-four jars of jam.

---

## Chunk 1098

Which table had more visitors?
When there were twenty-four jars of jam, 60 percent of the people coming by would
stop and taste. When there were six jars of jam only 40 percent of the people would
stop and taste. So having more choices was better, right? Not really.
Which table resulted in more tasting?
You might think that people would taste more jam when the table had twenty-four vari-

---

## Chunk 1099

eties. But they didn‚Äôt. People stopped at the table, but they only tasted a few varieties
whether there were six or twenty-four choices available. People can remember only
three or four things at a time (see the chapter ‚ÄúHow People Remember‚Äù); likewise they
can decide from among only three or four things at a time.
Which table resulted in more purchases?

---

## Chunk 1100

The most interesting part of Iyengar‚Äôs study is that 31 percent of the people who
stopped at the table with six jars actually made a purchase. But only 3 percent of the
206 HOW PEOPLE DECIDE

---

## Chunk 1101

--- Page 220 ---
people who stopped at the table with twenty-four jars actually made a purchase. So
even though more people stopped by, less people purchased. To give you an example
of the numbers, if 100 people came by (they actually had more than that in the study,
but 100 makes the calculations easy for our purposes), 60 of them would stop and try

---

## Chunk 1102

the jam at the twenty-four-jar table, but only two would make a purchase. Forty people
would stop and try the jam at the six-jar table, and twelve of them would actually make a
purchase.
WHY PEOPLE CAN‚ÄôT STOP
So if ‚Äúless is more,‚Äù then why do people always want more choices? It‚Äôs part of that
dopamine effect. Information is addictive. It‚Äôs only when people are confident in their

---

## Chunk 1103

decisions that they stop seeking more information.
Takeaways
Resist the impulse to provide your customers with a large number of choices.
If you ask people how many options they want, they will almost always say ‚Äúa lot‚Äù or
‚Äúgive me all the options.‚Äù So if you ask, be prepared to deviate from what they ask for.
If possible, limit the number of choices to three or four. If you have to offer more

---

## Chunk 1104

options, try to do so in a progressive way. For example, have people choose first from
three or four options, and then choose again from a subset.

PEOPLE THINK CHOICE
EQUALS CONTROL
InThe Art of Choosing (2010), Sheena Iyengar describes an experiment with rats. The
rats were given a choice of a direct path to food, or a path that had branches and there-
fore required choices to be made. Both paths resulted in access to the same food in the

---

## Chunk 1106

same amounts. If all the rats wanted was food, then they should take the short, direct
path. But the rats continuously preferred the path with branches.
In experiments with monkeys and pigeons, the animals learn to press buttons to get
food. If given a choice between one button and multiple buttons, both monkeys and
pigeons prefer multiple buttons.

---

## Chunk 1107

In similar research with humans, people were given chips to use at a casino. They
could use the chips at a table that had one roulette wheel, or at a table where they could
choose from two roulette wheels. People preferred the table with two wheels, even
though all three wheels were identical.
Even though it isn‚Äôt necessarily true, people equate having choices with having con-

trol. If people are to feel in control, then they need to feel that their actions are powerful
and that they have choices to make. Sometimes having many choices makes it harder
to get what they want, but they still want the choices so that they feel in control of the
decision.

Takeaways
People need to feel that they‚Äôre in control and that they have choices.
People won‚Äôt always choose the fastest way to complete a task. When you‚Äôre deciding
how your audience will accomplish a task with your Web site or product, you may want
to offer more than one way, even if the alternative methods are less efficient, just so
that people will have a choice.

---

## Chunk 1114

Once you‚Äôve given people choices, they‚Äôll be unhappy if you take those choices away.
If a new version of your product includes improved methods for accomplishing tasks,
you may want to leave some of the older methods in the product so that people feel
they have options.

PEOPLE MAY CARE ABOUT
TIME MORE THAN THEY CARE
ABOUT MONEY
Say you‚Äôre out for a Sunday bike ride on your favorite path, and you come across some
kids selling lemonade. Do you stop and buy lemonade? Do you like the lemonade?
Does your buying or liking the lemonade have anything to do with the wording on the
sign next to the lemonade stand? Apparently so.

---

## Chunk 1116

Cassie Mogilner and Jennifer Aaker (2009) from the Stanford Graduate School of
Business conducted a series of experiments to see whether references to time or refer-
ences to money would affect whether people stopped to buy, how much they were will-
ing to pay, and how satisfied they were with the products they bought. They conducted
five experiments.
SPENDING TIME VERSUS SPENDING MONEY

---

## Chunk 1117

The first study was the lemonade stand previously described. Sometimes there was a sign
that said, ‚ÄúSpend a little time, and enjoy C & D‚Äôs lemonade.‚Äù This was the ‚Äútime‚Äù condition.
Sometimes the sign said, ‚ÄúSpend a little money, and enjoy C & D‚Äôs lemonade‚Äù (money con-
dition) and other times the sign said, ‚ÄúEnjoy C & D‚Äôs lemonade‚Äù (control condition).

---

## Chunk 1118

A total of 391 people passed by either on foot or on bikes. Those who stopped to
purchase lemonade ranged in age from 14 to 50, and there was a mix of gender and
occupations. Customers could pay anywhere between $1 and $3 for a cup of lemon-
ade‚Äîthe customer decided on the price. The authors comment that the high price was

---

## Chunk 1119

justified by the fact that the customers got to keep the high-quality plastic cup. After cus-
tomers drank their lemonade, they completed a survey.
More people stopped to buy lemonade when the sign mentioned time (14 percent).
In fact, twice as many people stopped when time was mentioned than when money was
mentioned (7 percent). In addition, customers in the time condition paid more money for

---

## Chunk 1120

the lemonade ($2.50 on average) compared to the money condition ($1.38 on average).
Interestingly, the control condition was in between on both the number of people stop-
ping to purchase and the average price. In other words, mentioning time brought the
most customers and the most money, mentioning money brought the fewest customers

---

## Chunk 1121

and the least money, and mentioning neither was in between. The same was true when
customers filled out the satisfaction survey.
The researchers came up with the hypothesis that when you invoke time in the mes-
sage, you make more of a personal connection than when you invoke money. To test this

idea, they conducted four more experiments in the lab rather than in the field to see how
the time versus money messaging affected people‚Äôs ideas about purchasing iPods, lap-
tops, jeans, and cars.
PEOPLE WANT TO CONNECT
At the end of all the experiments, the researchers concluded that people are more

---

## Chunk 1123

willing to buy, spend more money, and like their purchases better if there‚Äôs a personal
connection. In most cases, that personal connection is triggered by references to time
instead of money. The idea is that mentioning time highlights your experience with the
product, and this thinking about the experience makes the personal connection.

---

## Chunk 1124

However, for certain products (such as designer jeans or prestige cars) or for certain
consumers (those who value possessions more than experiences), personal connection
is highlighted by mentioning money more than by mentioning time. These people are in
the minority, but they are out there.
Takeaways
The best thing to do, of course, is to know your market or audience. If they‚Äôre influ-

---

## Chunk 1125

enced by prestige and possessions, then by all means mention money.
Be aware that most people, most of the time, are more influenced by time and experi-
ences that produce a personal connection than money or possessions.
If you don‚Äôt have the time or budget to know your audience well, and if you‚Äôre selling
nonprestige items or services, then err on the side of time and experiences, and delay

the mention of money as long as possible.

MOOD INFLUENCES THE DECISION-
MAKING PROCESS
You have just been offered a new job. The work is interesting, and there‚Äôs more money,
but there are downsides, too. You‚Äôll probably have to travel more and work longer hours.
Should you take the new job or stay where you are? Your gut tells you to go for it, but

---

## Chunk 1128

when you sit down and make a list of pros and cons, the cons outweigh the pros, and the
logical method tells you to stay put. Which will you follow: your gut or your logic?
Marieke de Vries (2008) and her team conducted research to find out. They were
interested in the intersection between mood and decision-making strategies.

---

## Chunk 1129

Participants were shown a video clip of a funny part from a Muppets movie (happy
mood), or the movie Schindler‚Äôs List (sad mood). Next they were shown some Thermos
products. Some participants were told to choose which Thermos they‚Äôd like to win in a
lottery based on their first feeling (intuitive condition). Other participants were instructed

---

## Chunk 1130

to evaluate the different products in terms of the pros and cons of their features and attri-
butes (deliberative condition).
After the participants chose the Thermos they preferred, they estimated the mon-
etary value of their Thermos. Next they filled out a questionnaire that measured their
current mood, and lastly filled out a questionnaire that rated their usual style of decision

making, intuitive or deliberative.
Here is a summary of their results:
The video clips worked in terms of getting people into a happy or sad mood.
Participants who usually make intuitive decisions estimated the value of the
Thermos higher when given intuitive instructions.
Participants who usually make deliberate decisions estimated the value of the

## Chunk 1132

Thermos higher when given deliberate instructions.
Participants in a happy mood estimated the value of the Thermos higher when
making an intuitive decision, regardless of their usual decision-making style.
Participants in a sad mood estimated the value of the Thermos higher when
making a deliberative decision, regardless of their usual decision-making
style.
There were no gender differences.

Takeaways
Some people tend to make decisions intuitively, and others tend to make them in a
deliberate way.
People will estimate a product to be of higher value if they can make the decision in
their ‚Äúnatural‚Äù style.
If you can find out someone‚Äôs style, you can suggest to them how to make a decision
and that will result in a higher estimation of the value of a product.

---

## Chunk 1135

You can influence someone‚Äôs mood easily, for example, with a short video clip.
People in a good mood will rate a product as being more valuable if they are asked to
make the decision quickly based on their first feelings.
People in a sad mood will rate a product as being more valuable if they are asked to
make the decision in a more deliberate way.

---

## Chunk 1136

If you influence people‚Äôs mood, then you can suggest to them how to think about their
decision-making process. This will result in a higher estimation of the value of a prod-
uct or service.

GROUP DECISION MAKING
CAN BE FAULTY
Walk into any office building in the world and you‚Äôll find the conference rooms filled with
groups of people meeting and making decisions. Every day, thousands of decisions
in businesses and organizations are made by groups large and small. Unfortunately,
research shows that group decision making has some serious flaws.

---

## Chunk 1138

THE DANGER OF GROUP-THINK
Andreas Mojzisch and Stefan Schulz-Hardt (2010) presented people with information on
prospective job candidates. Everyone received and reviewed the information on their
own first, not together in a face-to-face group. One set of participants received informa-
tion on the preferences of the other people in the group before they began the review

---

## Chunk 1139

of the material, and another set of participants did not receive information on the prefer-
ences of the group before their review. Everyone then received the same information
on the candidates. To make the best decision, participants would have had to review all
the information given to them.
The researchers found that people who received information on the group‚Äôs prefer-

---

## Chunk 1140

ences before reviewing the candidate information did not review the candidate informa-
tion fully, and therefore did not make the best decisions. In a memory test, they did not
remember the most relevant information. The researchers concluded that when a group
of people starts a discussion by sharing their initial preferences, they spend less time

---

## Chunk 1141

and less attention on the information available outside the group‚Äôs preferences. And they
therefore make a less than optimal decision.
Mojzisch and Schulz-Hardt did a follow-up study where they changed the situation so
that the group was together face-to-face. In this study, each group member had different
information about the potential job candidates. They could only reach the best decision

---

## Chunk 1142

if all the group members shared their unique information. Again, if the group started by
talking about their initial preferences, they paid less attention to the relevant information
during the discussion and made the wrong decision.
Ninety percent of group discussions start off on the wrong foot

## Chunk 1146

by Bahador Bahrami shows that ‚Äútwo heads are better than one‚Äù if they talk together
and if they are both competent in their knowledge and skills.
Bahrami (2010) and his team found that pairs do better than individuals at making
decisions as long as they freely discuss their disagreements, not only about what they

---

## Chunk 1147

saw, but also about how confident they are about what they saw. If they aren‚Äôt allowed to
freely discuss, and they just give their decision, then the pair does not make better deci-
sions than an individual would.
Takeaways
If one person is less competent than the others, and that person doesn‚Äôt realize that he

## Chunk 1148

or she is, though the rest of the team does realize it, then the team tends to make poor
decisions because they should ignore the less competent member‚Äôs opinions, but
they don‚Äôt.
Give people a way and time to consider all relevant information on their own before
they see what other people think.
Ask people to rate how confident they are in their decision before they show that deci-

sion to others.
Once opinion sharing starts, make sure people have enough time to discuss their
disagreements.
It‚Äôs easy for people to share information now, and for that information to be widely dis-
seminated. This free flow of information and opinions may mean that people are collec-
tively making poorer decisions.

PEOPLE ARE SWAYED BY A
DOMINANT PERSONALITY
Anyone who has made a decision in a group, or facilitated a focus group, has had the
experience of seeing and hearing a dominant member of the group monopolize the
conversation and the decision. Just because decisions are made in a group setting
doesn‚Äôt mean that the entire group really made the decision. Many people give up in

## Chunk 1151

the presence of one or more dominant group members, and may not speak up at all.
WHY DOES THE LEADER BECOME THE LEADER?
Cameron Anderson and Gavin Kilduff (2009) researched group decision making. They
formed groups of four students each and had them solve math problems from the GMAT (a
standardized test for admission to graduate business school programs). Using standardized

---

## Chunk 1152

math problems allowed the researchers to evaluate how well the group solved the prob-
lems they were given. It also allowed them to compare each member‚Äôs competence by
looking at their previous SAT math scores from their undergraduate admission to college.
During the problem-solving session, the researchers videotaped the group conver-

---

## Chunk 1153

sations and reviewed them later to decide who was the leader of each group. They had
multiple sets of observers view the videos to see if there was consensus about who the
leaders were. They also asked the people in the groups to identify the leader of their
group. Everyone agreed on who the leader was in each group.

---

## Chunk 1154

Anderson and Kilduff were interested in why the leaders became the leaders. Before
the groups started, everyone filled out a questionnaire to measure their level of domi-
nance. As you might imagine, the leaders all scored high on the dominance measure.
But that still doesn‚Äôt suggest how they became leaders. Did they have the best math SAT

---

## Chunk 1155

scores? (No). Did they bully everyone else into letting them be the leader? (No).
The answer surprised the researchers: The leaders spoke first. For 94 percent of
the problems, the group‚Äôs final answer was the first answer that was proposed, and the
people with the dominant personalities always spoke first.
Takeaways

---

## Chunk 1156

If you design as a group, be careful of following the first solution just because it‚Äôs first.
If you have group meetings (for example, group sessions to make design decisions, or
group audience feedback sessions), have each member of the group write down ideas
ahead of time and circulate those ideas before the meeting.

ratings left by others. And chances are you‚Äôll listen to the reviews, even though the
people writing the reviews are total strangers.
UNCERTAINTY TIPS THE SCALE
In my book Neuro Web Design: What Makes Them Click? I talk about the tendency to
look to others to decide what to do. It‚Äôs called social validation.
Bibb Latane and John Darley (1970) conducted research in which they set up ambigu-

## Chunk 1159

ous situations to see if people were affected by what others around them were or were
not doing. Participants in the research would go into a room, supposedly to fill out a sur-
vey on creativity. In the room would be one or more other people, pretending they were
also participants, but who were really part of the experiment. Sometimes there would

---

## Chunk 1160

be one other person in the room, sometimes more. While people were filling out their
creativity survey, smoke would start to come into the room from an air vent. Would the
participant leave the room? Go tell someone about the smoke? Just ignore it?
PEOPLE TAKE ACTION ONLY IF OTHERS TAKE ACTION
What action, if any, the participant took depended on the behavior of the other

---

## Chunk 1161

people in the room, as well as how many other people there were. The more people,
and the more the others ignored the smoke, the more the participant was likely to do
nothing. If the participant was alone, he or she would leave the room and notify some-
one. But if there were others in the room and they didn‚Äôt react, then the participant
would do nothing.
TESTIMONIALS AND RATINGS ARE POWERFUL

## Chunk 1162

Online, social validation is most in evidence with ratings and reviews. When we‚Äôre

THEMSELVES
I do a lot of writing and speaking on the topic of persuasion. I often talk about John

not aware of. Bargh had people unscramble sets of words to make sentences. For

---

## Chunk 1167

example, he would ask people to choose four out of five words and make a sentence
out of them:
‚Äúhe florida today lives in‚Äù
would become:
‚ÄúHe lives in Florida.‚Äù
Some people got sets of words that had a theme of ‚Äúold,‚Äù such as Florida, retired,
old, and elderly. Other people got sets of words that had a young theme, such as youth,

---

## Chunk 1168

energy, and lively. A third group got neutral words that were neither old nor young. After
unscrambling the words and making sentences, Bargh would then have the participants
walk down the hall to find him. Bargh measured how long it took each person to walk down
the hall. People who had been using the ‚Äúold‚Äù words took much longer to walk down the

---

## Chunk 1169

hall. They had been unconsciously affected by the words. But when asked if they thought
the words had influenced them, they said no.
When I talk about this research, people believe that others would walk slowly, but
that they wouldn‚Äôt be affected by words in this way.
‚ÄúI‚ÄôM NOT THAT INFLUENCED‚Äù
In another example, when I discuss the research on social validation, such as that

regarding ratings and reviews in the previous topic, everyone in the room nods and
talks about how it‚Äôs true that other people are very influenced by ratings and reviews.

about how much we‚Äôre affected by pictures, images, and words, and that we don‚Äôt real-

THE THIRD-PERSON EFFECT
In fact, this belief that ‚Äúothers are affected but not me‚Äù is so common that there is
research on it, and it has its own name: the third-person effect. The research shows that
most people think others are influenced by persuasive messages, but that they them-
selves are not. The research shows that this perception is false. The third-person effect

---

## Chunk 1173

seems to be especially true if you think you aren‚Äôt interested in the topic. For example, if
you‚Äôre not in the market to buy a new TV, then you‚Äôll tend to think that advertising about
new TVs won‚Äôt affect you, but the research says that it will.
WHY DO PEOPLE DECEIVE THEMSELVES THIS WAY?
Why the self-deception? It‚Äôs partly because all this influence is happening unconsciously.

---

## Chunk 1174

People are literally unaware that they‚Äôre being influenced. And it‚Äôs also partly because
people don‚Äôt like to think of themselves as easily swayed, or gullible. To be gullible is
to not be in control, and the old brain‚Äîthe part that is concerned with survival‚Äîalways
wants us to be in control.
Takeaways
Everyone is affected by unconscious processes.

## Chunk 1175

If you‚Äôre doing customer research and people say, ‚ÄúRatings and reviews don‚Äôt influence
my decision,‚Äù don‚Äôt believe what they‚Äôre saying. Remember that these are unconscious
processes, and people are largely unaware of what is affecting them.

the way the item is displayed at the time you‚Äôre making the decision affect the dollar

this out.
In the first set of experiments, the researchers used snack food (potato chips, candy

Bushong and his team hypothesize that there‚Äôs a Pavlovian response going on: when

Takeaways
Brick-and-mortar stores may retain an edge if they have products on hand, especially
