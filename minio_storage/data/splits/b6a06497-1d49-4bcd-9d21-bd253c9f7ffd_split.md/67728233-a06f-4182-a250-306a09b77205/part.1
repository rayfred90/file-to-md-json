Introduction 10
Hi, I‚Äôm Adham
I‚Äôm a product designer from sunny Sydney, Australia, specialising in UI design
and design systems. Since 2005, I‚Äôve enjoyed working in startups, agencies,
corporations, and government. I‚Äôve led projects to design products used by
millions of people.

---

## Chunk 32

I‚Äôve been fortunate to have my work featured in books, magazines, and
websites around the world. I love design and enjoy sharing what I‚Äôve learned
with others. This book has been a labour of love and I've spent thousands of
hours creating it. I hope you find it helpful.

Introduction 11
UI design doesn‚Äôt have to be so hard
Interface design is hard. Having endless design possibilities sounds great in
theory, but in practice, it can be frustrating and time consuming. With so
many options to choose from regarding layout, spacing, typography, and
colour, making design decisions can be overwhelming. When you add

---

## Chunk 34

usability, accessibility, and psychology to the mix, it gets even harder.

---

## Chunk 35

Luckily, UI design doesn‚Äôt have to be so hard. Over the years, I‚Äôve realised
that most of my UI design decisions are governed by a system of logical
guidelines. Not artistic flair or magical intuition, just simple guidelines.

---

## Chunk 36

Sure, artistic talent helps, but a lot of what makes up an intuitive, accessible,
and beautiful interface design can be learned. Having a system of logical
guidelines helps you efficiently make informed design decisions. Without a
logical system, you‚Äôre just using gut feeling to move stuff around until it
looks pretty.

---

## Chunk 37

I wish I knew these guidelines when I first started out. They're a culmination
of nearly 2 decades working as a product designer on websites and apps
used by millions of people. My hope is that they‚Äôll help you gain years of
experience in a matter of hours.

---

## Chunk 38

--- Page 12 ---
Introduction 12
UI versus UX
The focus of this book is user interface (UI) design, which is made up of
visual and interaction design. What a product looks like and how it works.
UI design is a large part of user experience (UX) design.

---

## Chunk 39

You'll learn how to design the interface that people interact with when they
use a digital product. The actual pixels on a screen that make up a website or
app. What it looks like, how it works, and why it works that way.

---

## Chunk 40

There are lots of different types of digital interfaces, but this book mostly
concentrates on web and mobile applications. That being said, the guidelines
are universal and also apply to marketing websites, e-commerce websites,
software applications, and more.
Only what you need to know
There‚Äôs an overwhelming amount of design tips, videos, books, and articles

---

## Chunk 41

out there. You can spend a lot of time and money and end up even more
confused. Much UI design theory is high-level, impractical, and unnecessary.
I kept this book as concise and practical as possible to help you quickly cut
through the noise. It contains the most important things you need to know
about interface design, usability, and accessibility. A picture is worth a

---

## Chunk 42

thousand words, so I designed hundreds of visual examples to help
demonstrate concepts clearly and quickly.

---

## Chunk 43

There's a lot of UI design information out there, but you don't need to know it
all. I focussed on the 20% of knowledge that brings 80% of the results.

---

## Chunk 44

--- Page 13 ---
Introduction 13
How were these guidelines validated?
Most of the guidelines in this book are based on conventional best practices.
They've been tried, tested, and documented over many years by hundreds of
designers around the world.
Many of the guidelines are based on how our bodies work. How our eyes
perceive things, how our brains interpret them, and how we interact with a

---

## Chunk 45

user interface.
There are, of course, certain topics that have conflicting evidence and
opinions. In these cases, I‚Äôve looked at the evidence, weighed it up against
my own professional experience, and provided my opinion and rationale.

---

## Chunk 46

These guidelines should help you avoid most usability issues, but I‚Äôd
encourage you to conduct your own usability testing to further validate
design concepts.
Got feedback?
I don‚Äôt claim to know it all. In fact, it‚Äôs quite the opposite. The more I learn, the
more I realise how much I have yet to learn. I‚Äôm always open to hearing

---

## Chunk 47

different ideas or having my ideas constructively challenged. That‚Äôs how we
learn and grow as designers.
I‚Äôd love for this book to grow and improve over time, so let me know if you
have any thoughts or feedback at hi@adhamdannaway.com

A tutorial to apply what you‚Äôve learned
The best way to learn is by doing. At the end of each chapter, you‚Äôll practice
your new skills by doing a quick tutorial. You‚Äôll apply what you‚Äôve learned by
improving the following example. It‚Äôs an interface for a workout in a fictional
fitness app and it‚Äôs full of common design problems.

---

## Chunk 49

By the end of the book, you‚Äôll have fixed the problems and created an
intuitive, accessible, and beautiful design. All simply by applying some of the
guidelines from the book.

Fundamentals 17
Minimise usability risks
While it might not sound very fun or creative, I base many of my design
decisions on risk. The risk that someone could have difficulty using an
interface. For example 
Thin, light grey text can look sleek and trendy, but there‚Äôs a risk that some
may find it difficult to read.

---

## Chunk 55

Icons without labels can look clean and minimal, but there‚Äôs a risk that
some might not understand what the icons mean. This risk is greater for
those with cognitive and vision impairments. 
It might look nice to add colour to heading text, but there‚Äôs a risk that
some could mistake it for a link.
Usability testing should highlight large risks, but smaller ones could go

---

## Chunk 56

unnoticed. It depends on the diversity of users you test with and the
effectiveness of the testing. Most of the time you don‚Äôt know the different
types of people that will be using your product, so it‚Äôs safest to cater to as
diverse a range as possible.
Consider people with poor eyesight, low computer literacy, reduced dexterity
and cognitive ability. Make sure that your designs meet Web Content

---

## Chunk 57

Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).
These guidelines are a good benchmark for website accessibility. Aim to at
least meet WCAG 2.1 level AA requirements. This is the medium level of
conformance and a good place to start. You‚Äôll learn the accessibility
guidelines you need to know throughout the book.

---

## Chunk 58

--- Page 18 ---
Fundamentals 18
Keep an eye out for potential usability risks. If there‚Äôs anything that‚Äôs slightly
vague, confusing or unclear, simplify it to make it crystal clear before
investing time and money in usability testing. I‚Äôll refer to usability risks often
throughout this book to help you see risks that you may not have been aware

---

## Chunk 59

of. I‚Äôll also provide practical advice to decrease usability risks.
The following example contains the 3 usability risks mentioned previously
(low contrast text, icons without labels, and blue heading text) along with a
bunch of others. You‚Äôll learn logical guidelines throughout the book to help
you fix usability risks like these.

Have a logical reason for every design detail
The importance of UI design is often trivialised as being nothing more than
making an interface look pretty. I think this demonstrates an ignorance of the
logic behind UI design. Sure, some elements are purely decorative, but if an
interface is designed well, every detail will have a logical reason behind it

---

## Chunk 64

that improves usability.
I‚Äôm not saying that aesthetics aren‚Äôt important, but UI design is about so
much more than how it looks. It‚Äôs about how it works and why it works that
way. When designing an interface, you‚Äôre literally designing the user‚Äôs
experience.
Designing interfaces using objective logic, rather than subjective opinion,

---

## Chunk 65

makes it faster and easier to make design decisions. It also helps you support
your decisions in discussions and provide constructive feedback to other
designers. ‚ÄúThat looks nice‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like it‚Äù are just subjective opinions, not
logical or constructive feedback.

---

## Chunk 66

It‚Äôs important to have a rationale (logical reason) behind each design decision
you make and to be able to clearly articulate it to support your designs. Every
guideline in this book includes a rationale to help you understand the why
behind the UI.

---

## Chunk 67

Let‚Äôs look at the rationale behind a well designed row of text blocks with
icons. It may look simple, but it was carefully designed using many logical
guidelines.

Here are some of the logical reasons behind this design, which you‚Äôll learn
about throughout the book 
Icons and text are left aligned to create a neat left edge. This improves
readability and aesthetics while decreasing cognitive load

---

## Chunk 70

Headings and text links are descriptive so they‚Äôre scannable and can be
read out of context by screen readers 
Secondary text is less important than headings, so it‚Äôs made less
prominent (using size and contrast) to create a clear visual hierarchy. 
Secondary text line height is at least 1.5 to improve readability 
Text links are coloured blue to indicate they‚Äôre interactive and underlined

---

## Chunk 71

so the colour blind can distinguish them from other text. 
Spacing inside each block is less than the spacing between each block to
create groups of related information. Spacing is based on a set of
predefined spacing options to improve consistency 
Information is broken up into smaller groups to make it easier to
understand and to help speed up decision making

---

## Chunk 72

Colours are based on an accessible monochromatic colour palette with
rules that govern its usage.

## Chunk 73

Fundamentals 21
Minimise interaction cost
Interaction cost is the sum of physical and mental effort required to achieve a
task. Looking, scrolling, searching, reading, clicking, waiting, typing, thinking,
and remembering all add to interaction cost. The higher the interaction cost,
the harder it is for someone to achieve their task.

---

## Chunk 74

The great thing about interaction cost is that you can measure it. This means
you can try to minimise it to make it easier for people to achieve their goals.
Of course, the more features a product provides, the harder it is to keep
interaction costs down. This is one of the reasons why simple apps that
focus on doing a specific task efficiently, are often the most successful.

---

## Chunk 75

How to minimise interaction cost
Many of the guidelines in this book help to minimise interaction cost, but here
are 3 of the most effective:
1. Keep related actions close
According to Fitts‚Äôs Law, the closer and larger a target, the faster it is to click
on that target. Keep actions close to the element they relate to and try to

---

## Chunk 76

ensure they have a sufficient target area (at least 48pt by 48pt is a safe
size). You‚Äôll learn about points (pt) in the ‚ÄúLayout and spacing‚Äù chapter.
2. Reduce distractions
Attention grabbing distractions like animated banners, pop-ups, and
unnecessary visuals, can pull people‚Äôs attention away from the task they‚Äôre
trying to complete.

---

## Chunk 77

--- Page 22 ---
Fundamentals 22
3. Minimise choice
According to Hick‚Äôs Law, the time it takes to make a decision increases with
the number and complexity of choices. Reduce choices to speed up
decisions. You can also highlight a smaller set of recommended or popular
items to help people make decisions faster.
An interaction cost example

---

## Chunk 78

In the following product page example, let‚Äôs say you want to add 2 products
to your cart. You need to select the quantity via a dropdown, which requires 1
click, 1 scroll, and another click. This can be especially difficult for those with
motor impairments. Then you need to move your mouse across to the ‚ÄúAdd to
cart‚Äù button and click it.

---

## Chunk 79

The total interaction cost is 3 clicks, 1 scroll, and a short mouse movement.

---

## Chunk 81

--- Page 23 ---
Fundamentals 23
In the next example, we reduce the interaction cost using a stepper for the
quantity instead of a dropdown. A stepper component makes it easier and
faster for people to make small numeric changes. It allows people to increase
or decrease a number with a single button press or by typing the number in
the field.

---

## Chunk 82

We move the ‚ÄúAdd to cart‚Äù button closer to the quantity selector to further
reduce interaction cost. Left aligning the button also helps ensure the button
won‚Äôt be missed by those using screen magnifiers.
We reduced the total interaction cost to 2 clicks and a very small mouse
movement. A similar approach can be taken to reduce the interaction cost on
any interface.

Minimise cognitive load
Cognitive load is the amount of brain power required to use an interface. The
goal is to minimise cognitive load to make your interface as easy to use as
possible. This frees up mental resources for people to focus on the task
they're trying to achieve.
Quick ways to reduce unnecessary cognitive load

Removing unnecessary styles, information, and decisions to reduce

in a similar way

Creating a clear visual hierarchy to show the level of importance of

## Chunk 87

Many of the guidelines in this book help to reduce cognitive load. It‚Äôs an
important concept to keep in mind when designing any interface.

---

## Chunk 88

Fundamentals 25
In the following example, cognitive load is reduced by breaking up a large,
complex form into smaller, simpler steps. People can get overwhelmed by
large, complex problems. Breaking them down into smaller, simpler ones

Create a design system
Having endless design possibilities sounds great in theory, but in practice, it
can be frustrating and time consuming. When designing an interface, there
are so many options to choose from regarding layout, spacing, typography,
and colour, it can quickly get overwhelming.

---

## Chunk 92

That‚Äôs why having a system of predefined options and guidelines to help you
efficiently make design decisions is crucial. This is known as a design system
and you can create one in 3 steps 
Set predefined style option 
Create reusable module 
Define usage guidelines

---

## Chunk 93

--- Page 27 ---
Fundamentals 27
1. Set predefined style options
Rather than choosing from unlimited options for things like colour,
typography, and spacing, create a small set of predefined options to choose
from. Limiting your options in this way helps improve consistency and speeds
up decision making. These predefined reusable options are often referred to
as ‚Äútokens‚Äù.
Colour options

---

## Chunk 94

Create a small set of predefined colour options called a colour palette. The
following colour palette is made up of variations of the brand colour. Each
colour has a purpose to help you quickly decide how and where to use it.
For example, actions like buttons and text links are often assigned the brand
colour from the colour palette. Using a consistent colour for interactive

## Chunk 95

elements helps teach people what‚Äôs interactive and what‚Äôs not.
Brand
Text strong Text weak Stroke strong Stroke weak Fill
Similarly, there‚Äôs no need to spend countless hours searching for different
shades of grey for form input borders, checkbox borders, and radio button
borders. Simply assign a colour variation from the colour palette to use for all
interface element borders.

---

## Chunk 96

You‚Äôll learn how to create simple, powerful, and accessible colour palettes
with rules that govern their usage, later in the ‚ÄúColour‚Äù chapter.

---

## Chunk 97

Fundamentals 28
Typography options
Create a small set of predefined typography options for different text types.
Define the font sizes, line-heights and weights once and reuse them
throughout an interface. I used a set of typography options similar to the
following one to create the examples in this book.
You‚Äôll learn how to use a type scale to create a set of typography options

Spacing options
Deciding on the ideal spacing between interface elements can be a
frustrating and time consuming process, as there are so many options to
choose from. In my early days as a designer, I remember painstakingly
pushing interface elements back and forth, a pixel at a time, until they
looked perfect.

---

## Chunk 100

Creating a limited set of predefined spacing options (as seen below) can
speed up your design process significantly, making you a much more
efficient designer. Using consistent spacing options will also result in a
neater, simpler interface design that‚Äôs faster to build.

---

## Chunk 101

You‚Äôll learn how to define a set of spacing options and how to apply them
later in the ‚ÄúLayout and spacing‚Äù chapter.

2. Create reusable modules
Modular design involves breaking things down into smaller, reusable, and
replaceable parts called modules or components. Modular design has been
used to create cars, machines, buildings, and computers for many years. It‚Äôs
a great way to improve productivity, efficiency and consistency.

---

## Chunk 105

Always aim to design interfaces in a modular way by doing the following: 
Start by creating the smallest components such as buttons, avatars, and
form input fields. These will be your building blocks 
Combine small components to create larger, more complex ones 
Arrange components in specific layouts to create reusable page
templates.
Small components Large component Template

---

## Chunk 106

The goal is to create a collection of all components, known as a component
library or UI kit. This makes it easy to view, manage, and reuse components.

---

## Chunk 107

Fundamentals 32
In the following example, an avatar component is used to create larger
components. Firstly, the avatar is paired with text, then placed in a card,
which is placed in a list of cards on a landing page template.

3. Define usage guidelines
Many design systems forget to include guidance on how to use the
components and visual styles in the system. Without clear usage guidelines,
there‚Äôs little chance that a team of designers will be able to design a
consistent product experience.

---

## Chunk 113

How to write the text content for an interface clearly and consistently is also
very important and is often overlooked. You‚Äôll learn key guidelines for how to
write interface text later in the ‚ÄúCopywriting‚Äù chapter.

## Chunk 114

I created a design system to help design the examples in this book. Some of
the high level usage guidelines include

Ensure an interface is accessible
As designers, it‚Äôs our responsibility to try and ensure the interfaces we
design can be used and understood by the widest audience possible. It‚Äôs
even a legal requirement in some countries.

---

## Chunk 116

We need to accommodate people with disabilities such as blindness, low
vision, colour blindness, motor impairment, and mental disabilities. An
accessible interface can be used by everyone, regardless of disability.
Keep the following in mind to help ensure an interface is accessible to all 
Try to provide a comparable experience for all

Good accessibility benefits everyone
An accessible interface benefits everyone, not just those with permanent
disabilities. Anyone could get an eye or arm injury, giving them a temporary
disability until they recover. Even those with perfect sight might find it
difficult to see their screen on a bright sunny day, giving them a temporary
situational disability.

---

## Chunk 123

Many of the guidelines for creating an accessible interface for people with
disabilities also helps create a more user-friendly interface for everyone else.
Things like ensuring sufficient contrast, minimising interaction cost, and
minimising cognitive load, are all essential for good usability.

## Chunk 124

Making our products accessible doesn‚Äôt just benefit user experience, it‚Äôs
necessary for sustainable business growth and success. A significant
number of people have some form of permanent disability, and we‚Äôll all
experience temporary and situational disabilities at various points in our lives.

---

## Chunk 125

Not having an accessible product means you could be missing out on
potential customers. It also means that many of your existing customers are
suffering a lesser user experience.

---

## Chunk 126

Fundamentals 38
Assistive technology
People with disabilities often use software and other devices to assist them
with using digital interfaces. It‚Äôs important to be aware of the 2 most common
assistive technologies, as they affect interface design.
Screen readers
A screen reader is software that describes an interface (using speech or

---

## Chunk 127

braille) to someone who can‚Äôt see it. Computer users use their keyboard to
step through interface elements which are read to them. Mobile users swipe
through interface elements or drag their finger across the screen, getting
what‚Äôs under their finger read to them.
Much of what makes an interface accessible by a screen reader depends on

---

## Chunk 128

the front end code (which isn‚Äôt covered in this book), but it‚Äôs important to
know about screen readers as a designer too.

Fundamentals 39
Screen magnifiers
A screen magnifier is software that enlarges part of an interface to make it
easier for people with low vision to see. They‚Äôre more widely used than
screen readers and are often used in conjunction with screen readers.

---

## Chunk 130

Those using screen magnification have a limited view of an interface, as they
can only see a small part of it at a time. It‚Äôs important to keep this in mind
when designing an interface. You‚Äôll learn how to cater to those using screen
magnifiers throughout the book.

Use common design patterns
According to Jakob‚Äôs Law, it‚Äôs safest to stick with common or conventional
design patterns that people are already familiar with. Design patterns are
established solutions to recurring problems.
For example, the following accordion component is a common design pattern

---

## Chunk 133

used to save space when displaying information. Accordions turn sections of
content into a scannable list, allowing people to quickly view the content
they need and ignore what they don‚Äôt. They generally look like a list and
include an icon to indicate that each list item can be expanded.

Use the 80/20 Rule to prioritise
Also called the Pareto Principle, the idea of the 80/20 Rule is that roughly
80% of effects come from 20% of the causes. Here are a few ways the 80/20
Rule relates to product design 
Roughly 80% of your users use 20% of your features 
Roughly 80% of customer complaints come from 20% of product issues

---

## Chunk 141

Roughly 80% of a customer‚Äôs attention is spent on 20% of a web page.
The 80/20 Rule isn‚Äôt an exact measure, it states that a relatively small number
of things will have a large impact. So, it‚Äôs best to prioritise putting effort into
improving the small number of things that will have the largest impact.

---

## Chunk 142

For example, optimise your interface design to cater to the tasks most
people will be doing, rather than spending time on edge cases (uncommon
cases) that will rarely be used.

Keep costs in mind
If you‚Äôre working on a commercial project, time isn‚Äôt free. Every minute spent

## Chunk 144

Consider using an existing design system, website template, or icon set
to save time. 
Outsource time-intensive tasks like illustrations to other designers 
Stick with familiar UI patterns to save time and money on usability testing.
For example, stick with conventional form fields that people are familiar
with, rather than designing bespoke ones that look and behave
differently.

## Chunk 145

Learn how interfaces are built and coded to get a better idea of their
technical constraints. This will help you design products that are easier,
faster, and cheaper to build 
Talk to developers early and often to discuss how you might achieve more
from your design for less. The simple approach is usually cheaper to build
and easier for customers to understand and use.

Fundamentals 44
Be consistent
Consistency in UI design means that similar elements look and work in a
similar way. This should be true both within your product and when
compared with other well-established products. This predictable
functionality improves usability and reduces errors, as people don‚Äôt
need to keep learning how things work.
Be consistent within your product

Remove unnecessary styles
Just like unnecessary information can be distracting and increase cognitive
load, so can unnecessary styles. Avoid unnecessary lines, colours,
backgrounds, and animations to create a simpler, more focused interface.

aesthetics are important, but try to ensure they don‚Äôt hinder usability.

In the following example, there are multiple unnecessary styles 
The list items have decorative colours and styles that lack purpose. This
could be confusing to some who assume the colours have meaning.

Style trends fade
It‚Äôs tempting to use the latest popular visual style trends, but just remember
that trends are always changing. The more trendy effects you use, the worse
your interface will age over time. Sticking with minimal styles that highlight
quality content is better for longevity.

## Chunk 189

While many popular visual styles look great, some simply aren‚Äôt practical in
real-world products, as they‚Äôre prone to usability and accessibility issues. In
the following ‚ÄúGlassmorphic‚Äù and ‚ÄúNeuomorphic‚Äù style examples, it‚Äôs very

Not all links need to be underlined
For accessibility, consistency and good usability, it‚Äôs safest to make text links
coloured and underlined. This conventional link treatment helps differentiate
links from other text and clearly indicates interactivity.

The cards in the following example still feel interactive, with or without the
conventional link treatment. The combination of image and text inside a
raised container are sufficient visual cues to indicate the card is interactive.

Use progressive disclosure
Progressive disclosure is the act of revealing information gradually as

hand, rather than overwhelming them with all of the information upfront. For
those who want more information, allow them to access it easily.

Design for the smallest screen first
Assuming your product will be used across a range of different screen sizes,
start designing on the smallest size first. The restricted space will force you
to prioritise important elements and remove unnecessary ones.

---

## Chunk 215

This approach should also help ensure your interface is simpler on larger
screens too. If you start designing an interface on a large screen first, there‚Äôs
a tendency to want to fill the screen with more information, as there‚Äôs lots of
room. You don‚Äôt need to fill the screen, as more information can increase
cognitive load and slow down decision making.

## Chunk 216

It‚Äôs similar to living in a large home compared to a small one. We tend to fill
large homes with lots of stuff we don‚Äôt need. Whereas, in a small one, we

Reduce choice to speed up decision making
According to Hick‚Äôs Law, the time it takes to make a decision increases with
the number and complexity of choices. That means you should aim to
present less choices more simply to help people make decisions faster.

1. Remove choices
The most obvious way to reduce choices is to actually remove them. While
this isn‚Äôt always possible, it‚Äôs good to keep in mind. Whether you‚Äôre designing
a form, a navigation, or a landing page, make sure that every option earns its
place. If it‚Äôs not necessary, it‚Äôs a potential distraction that you should
consider removing.

An improved way to measure contrast
There‚Äôs a new and improved way to measure contrast using the Accessible
Perceptual Contrast Algorithm (APCA). It‚Äôs part of the WCAG 3 draft and it
helps solve some of the limitations of the WCAG 2 method.

---

## Chunk 265

In the following example, white text on an orange background fails WCAG 2,
while black text passes. This doesn‚Äôt make sense, as the white text is clearly
easier to read. Using APCA, the white text passes and the black text fails.
This matches our actual perception of the text.

No more ratios
Rather than ratios, APCA contrast is measured in numbers. The higher the
number, the higher the contrast. The APCA contrast value also depends on
the size and weight of text. Smaller and thinner text gets a lower score.

Should I start using APCA?
If you‚Äôre working on a personal project, start using APCA, as it results in a
more accessible interface. It‚Äôs also easier to comply with contrast
requirements, as it fixes many of the issues with WCAG 2.
For commercial projects, where accessibility compliance is a requirement, it‚Äôs

safest to stick with WCAG 2 until WCAG 3 is released. That being said, you
should try to ensure your contrast passes both for optimal results.

Don‚Äôt rely on colour alone to convey
meaning
There are many different types of colour blindness and they mainly affect

Colour 86
In the previous example, the colour red is used to indicate an error with a
form field. If colour is removed, there‚Äôs nothing else to differentiate the error
field from other form fields. You can fix this by adding an icon, thicker border,
and background shade. This also makes the error state more obvious to
others who aren‚Äôt colour blind.

In the next example, the reviews text link is coloured blue to indicate that it‚Äôs
interactive. If colour is removed from the interface, the text link looks the
same as other text, so the colour blind can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs a link. You can fix this by
underlining the text link to clearly differentiate it from other text.

Use colour to define a clear visual hierarchy
Not all information in an interface has the same level of importance. Aim to
present information in order of importance by making more important

Saturation is the degree of richness or intensity of a colour. Use saturated
colours for more important elements. For example, use a saturated colour for
text links and buttons to help them stand out.

Many brands avoid colour and use black and white for a timeless look and

Black and white are the foundations that most interfaces are built on. It‚Äôs a
good idea to design interfaces without colour first, regardless of the brand
colours. Designing in black and white first helps you focus on spacing, size,
layout, and contrast, without the extra challenge of colour.

Many of the top brands use a single unique colour, alongside black and
white, to help convey the brand mood or personality. This works well for
interface design, as you can use the brand colour purposefully to indicate
interactive elements. You might recognise some of the following brand
representations based solely on their brand colour.

Use changes in opacity to indicate interaction states. This means that you
don‚Äôt have to introduce any new colours to the palette. The hover state could
have an opacity of 80%, while the disabled state could have an opacity of
20% to help indicate that it‚Äôs not interactive. An outline is generally used to
indicate the focus state.

Create a dark colour palette
Dark interfaces are quickly growing in popularity. Many websites and apps
allow you to switch between light and dark mode based on your preference.
Others automatically switch based on the time of day. Some brands opt for a
dark only aesthetic to create a dramatic, powerful, or luxurious feel.

---

## Chunk 383

There‚Äôs conflicting evidence on whether dark interfaces are better for your
eyes or not. Some believe that they can reduce eye strain, as they‚Äôre less
bright. Others believe that dark interface details can be difficult to see,
especially in bright, sunny environments. So it‚Äôs especially important to
ensure dark interfaces have sufficient contrast.

---

## Chunk 384

Luckily, you can create a dark colour palette in a similar way to the light one.

Use the main brand colour hue as a base and change the saturation and

Add depth using colour and shadows
To add depth to an interface, use colour and shadows to raise or lower
interface elements to different levels of elevation. Elements with a higher
elevation appear closer to you and are more prominent. Those with a lower
elevation appear further away and are less prominent.
Define 2 shadow options

---

## Chunk 395

Including shadow options in your design system saves time and improves
consistency. For most projects you‚Äôll only need the following shadow options 
Raised - a small and sharp shadow used to slightly elevate interactive
elements like cards 
Overlay - a larger and softer shadow used for elements that float high
above the page like dropdown menus and floating dialog boxes.

Use colour to indicate depth
Shadows aren‚Äôt the only way to add depth to an interface. Light comes from
above, so light colours tend to look more elevated than dark ones. Add depth

However, shadows can be difficult to see in dark interfaces, so you mostly
need to rely on colour to indicate depth.

Take your background colour as your base and define 2 progressively
brighter background colours to help indicate elevation above the page.
This gives you 3 background colours to use when designing dark interfaces: 
Base - darkest colour for the main background

Overlay - slightly brighter than the raised colour.

Solid colours have an opacity of 100%, which means that you can‚Äôt see
through them. Lowering the opacity of a colour makes it more transparent

## Chunk 410

In the following example, some tags (small pill-shaped elements used to
categorise or label content) sit on a white background, while others sit on a
grey background. Tags with a solid grey fill look less prominent on the grey
background, which affects their visual hierarchy. Ideally, these tags should
always look slightly more prominent than the background they sit on to help
them stand out.

important to make sure they work well together. Test your colour palette
using an interface example that contains all colour variations.
The interface doesn‚Äôt need to make sense, as you‚Äôre just looking at colours.

Neutral versus monochromatic greys
Now that you know how to create a neutral transparent colour palette, it‚Äôs
easy to move to monochromatic greys, if that‚Äôs your preference. There‚Äôs
nothing wrong with neutral greys though. They work well with any brand
colour or content and have a subtle warmth.

Creating a monochromatic transparent colour palette
In dark mode, simply add a tinge of the brand colour to the background
colours. For each background colour, change the hue to the brand colour and
saturate it slightly.

In light mode, rather than using different opacities of black for foreground
colours, add a tinge of the brand colour.
For each foreground variation of black, change the hue to the brand colour
and the saturation to 100. Start with a low brightness for the ‚ÄúText strong‚Äù

Name colours to keep them organised
So far, you‚Äôve created a colour palette with high level rules that govern how
colours should be used. This is fine if it‚Äôs just you working on a simple
product, but if there are multiple designers and developers involved, you‚Äôll
need to name and organise colours systematically. This helps to ensure that

---

## Chunk 466

colours are applied correctly and consistently.
Colours are commonly named in 2 ways 
Primitive colours - includes all available colours in the design system.
Colours are named based on their appearance and shouldn‚Äôt be used
directly in your designs 
Semantic colours - also known as ‚Äúcolour tokens‚Äù, refers to a way of
naming primitive colours based on how they should be used. A single

Naming primitive colours
Name primitive colours based on their appearance. Assign each variation of a
colour hue a number from 0 to 1000. This indicates its level of contrast
relative to the other variations. 1000 has the highest level of contrast.
Primitive colour names should have the following format:

Naming semantic colours
You can name semantic colours in many different ways. The following naming
structure is simple but powerful. It‚Äôs easy to learn and flexible enough to grow
for larger and more complex design systems.

The name of each colour consists of up to 4 words that describe how and
where to use the colour on an interface:

Adjust photo colour temperature to match
the colour palette
Rather than a guideline, this is a quick trick that can help you create a
harmonious look and feel. You may have noticed that some photos look
warmer or more orange and others look cooler or more blue. This is due to
their colour temperature, which is a measure of the colour of light.

---

## Chunk 483

If your colour palette is based on a cool colour like blue, using photos with a
cooler colour temperature can help create a more cohesive look and feel. The
opposite applies to warm colour palettes. You can use a photo editing tool to
adjust the colour temperature of photos.

---

## Chunk 484

The middle photo below is the original. The colour temperature of the left
photo was decreased, while the one on the right was increased.
This little trick isn‚Äôt for product photos where realistic colours are important.
It can, however, come in handy for decorative photos where you want to
create a harmonious feel.

4. Align related elements in a continuous line
According to the principle of continuity, people perceive elements that are
arranged in a continuous line to be related. Our eyes naturally tend to follow
elements aligned in continuous straight or curved lines. You can use this to
your advantage to help guide people‚Äôs eyes through an interface.

---

## Chunk 562

Lists are a common way of using continuity to group related elements in an
interface. You can disrupt continuity to indicate the end of a group of related
elements or to highlight a particular element.

The following example of a property booking app demonstrates the power of

Use depth to create visual hierarchy
To add depth to an interface, use colour and shadows to raise or lower
interface elements to different levels of elevation. Elements with a higher
elevation appear closer to you and are more prominent. Those with a lower
elevation appear further away and are less prominent.

---

## Chunk 605

Use different levels of elevation to help create a clear order of importance or
visual hierarchy. More important things should be elevated higher to make
them more prominent. Elevation can also make interface elements feel
interactive.

---

## Chunk 606

In the following example, you can see how adding depth makes the visual
hierarchy clearer. Elevating the top header to sit above the notification feed
ensures users can navigate back to the previous screen. Elevating the
primary button even higher ensures it‚Äôs the most prominent element.

Understand the box model
You may have heard a joke that designers get paid to move rectangles
around on a screen. While it‚Äôs a very simplistic view, it‚Äôs basically true.
Interfaces are made up of lots of rectangles within rectangles.

---

## Chunk 610

It‚Äôs important to understand how these rectangles, or boxes, work and
interact. Each rectangle can have an outer margin, inner padding, and a
border according to the box model 
Margin - the space between the box and neighbouring boxes 
Border - the stroke around the edge of the box 
Padding - the space between the border and the contents of the box.

was equal to 1 pixel (px). A pixel is the smallest piece of a screen that can
display colours.
Nowadays, screen resolutions are higher, so 1pt may be equal to 4px (2px x
2px) on a ‚Äú@2x‚Äù resolution, or 9px (3px x 3px) on a ‚Äú@3x‚Äù resolution.
@1x @2x @3x

## Chunk 616

1pt = 1px 1pt = 4px 1pt = 9px
Points versus pixels on different screen resolutions
For UI design, always work in points. This is often called working ‚Äú@1x‚Äù and
most design tools are configured to work like this by default.

Create a set of predefined spacing options
Deciding on the ideal spacing between interface elements can be a
frustrating and time consuming task. There are endless options to choose
from. Rather than using trial and error, one pixel at a time, create a simple set
of predefined spacing options to make decisions faster.

points. For more detailed interfaces, you could use 4 point increments for a
bit more control.

## Chunk 620

Much like a typography scale, your spacing options should grow by larger
amounts as they get bigger. This ensures that spacing is proportional for
larger interface elements.

Benefits of using a predefined set of spacing options 
Simplified designs - as there‚Äôs less variation between spacing 
Improved consistency - as spacing across interface elements will match 
Design faster - as there are fewer options to choose from.

Space elements based on how closely
related they are
It‚Äôs great that we have a set of predefined spacing options, but how do we
know which spacing option to use? The amount of spacing between interface
elements should depend on how closely related the elements are.

## Chunk 625

More closely related elements should generally be closer together to show
that they‚Äôre related. Unrelated elements should be separated by placing more
space between them.
Using spacing in this way is one of the most powerful methods of breaking
up information into smaller groups. If you think of each group as a rectangle,
you‚Äôll start to notice that interfaces are made up of many small rectangles

Align the main layout to a 12 column grid
The more interface elements you align, the more ordered and structured your
interface will appear. This reduces cognitive load and makes it easier for
people to understand an interface. A quick and simple way to improve
alignment is to use a 12 column grid.
What‚Äôs a 12 column grid?

---

## Chunk 651

A 12 column grid consists of 12 vertical columns separated by empty spaces
called gutters. Outer margins prevent the content from hitting the left and
right edges of a screen. Columns provide a structure for the layout of the
main elements of an interface to align with.

Columns
Create different page layouts by aligning the main containers to one or more
columns. Smaller elements inside the main layout containers don‚Äôt need to
align to the 12 columns. Use your predefined spacing options for these
smaller elements.

---

## Chunk 654

Columns generally have a flexible width, defined with percentages, rather
than a fixed width. This allows them to adapt to different screen sizes. Start
with 12 columns for large screen sizes, like desktops and laptops. Decrease
the number of columns for smaller screens, like tablets and mobiles.
For example, on a large screen, 3 content cards might be aligned in a row

Gutters
The purpose of gutters is to separate and align columns of content, not to
contain content. Gutters should remain empty and should be narrower than
columns. Gutters generally have a fixed width and are often wider on larger
screens to keep spacing proportional.
For example, a large (32pt) predefined spacing option might be used for

Align text to improve readability
Left aligned text is easiest to read because each line starts along the same
straight left edge. This gives your eyes a consistent anchor to quickly jump
back to at the end of each line. Try to maintain a straight left edge when
aligning text with other interface elements like icons.

---

## Chunk 662

In the following example, the icon placement breaks the straight left edge.
You can feel your eyes working slightly harder to go from the heading to the
secondary text. This adds unnecessary cognitive load.

---

## Chunk 684

The category list is placed in the middle of the screen for aesthetic reasons,
but it‚Äôs quite far from the initial tap position in the top left. The close button is
also relatively far from the initial tap position. This causes you to spend
slightly more time and effort navigating to a category or closing the menu.

---

## Chunk 685

The size and tap area of the category menu items are also relatively small,
which means you need to be more precise when tapping them. Again, this

Use the Rule of Thirds for photos
The Rule of Thirds is a simple but effective way to make photos look more
balanced, natural, and dynamic. Let‚Äôs learn how to use it.

---

## Chunk 695

Divide your photo into thirds by creating a grid that‚Äôs 3 columns wide and 3
rows tall. This creates 4 focal points where the lines intersect. Our eyes
naturally gravitate towards these focal points. Try to roughly align key
elements of your photo to the grid, ensuring that the main subject sits on
one of the 4 focal points.
Centre alignment versus alignment using the Rule of Thirds

---

## Chunk 696

In this example, the focal point is the person‚Äôs eyes. If you simply position
their eyes in the centre of the photo, you end up with a very symmetrical
photo that looks a bit rigid and still.

---

## Chunk 697

If you move their eyes to align with one of the 4 focal points on the grid, the
asymmetry introduces a sense of natural motion and flow.

---

## Chunk 698

Layout and spacing 218
The Rule of Thirds is especially effective for action shots, as it increases the
sense of motion already present in the photo. In the following photo, align the
surfer to a focal point and ensure that the top of the wave aligns with the
horizontal grid.

Use a single sans serif typeface
It‚Äôs safest to use a single sans serif typeface for most interface designs. To
see why, let‚Äôs learn a bit about typefaces.
A typeface is a set of related fonts with a similar style or aesthetic. Helvetica
is an example of a san serif typeface. Fonts are variations within a typeface,

---

## Chunk 738

like weights or sizes. For example, Helvetica Bold and Helvetica Regular are 2
different fonts within the Helvetica typeface.

---

## Chunk 739

There are 5 main classifications of typefaces: serif, sans serif, script, display,
and monospaced.

Serif typefaces
Serif typefaces include decorative tails or feet at the ends of letters
(highlighted below). They often convey a traditional, classic, or formal mood.
Some serifs are more legible than others and can be used at small sizes.
Others are better suited for use at large sizes.

Sans serif typefaces

---

## Chunk 741

Sans serif typefaces don‚Äôt include decorative tails or feet at the ends of
letters. They generally look more modern due to their simplicity. Sans serif
typefaces are highly legible, making them suitable for use at small and large
sizes. Due to their simplicity and lack of character, sans serif typefaces are a
safe and neutral option that suits most interface designs.

Script typefaces
Script typefaces are based on handwriting. Their low legibility means that
they‚Äôre not suitable for use at small sizes. Script typefaces can be effective at
conveying a formal or casual mood at large sizes.
Script
Display typefaces
Display typefaces come in a wide range of varied styles. They‚Äôre decorative

## Chunk 743

typefaces specifically designed to be read at large sizes. Due to their strong
character and detail, they can be especially good at conveying a range of
different moods. Display typefaces aren‚Äôt suitable for use at small sizes due
to their visual complexity.

## Chunk 744

Typography 233
Monospaced typefaces
In most typefaces, the horizontal space that a character takes up depends
on its natural width. For example, an ‚Äúi‚Äù takes up less space than a ‚Äúw‚Äù. In a
monospaced typeface, every character takes up the same amount of
horizontal space.
For this reason, they‚Äôre often used for displaying code. They‚Äôre also useful for

Reasons to use a single sans serif typeface
If you‚Äôre just starting out, it‚Äôs safest to use a single sans serif typeface for
most interface designs for the following 3 reasons:
1. Legibility
Legibility is a measure of how easily individual characters can be
distinguished and identified. Sans serif typefaces are generally the most

---

## Chunk 747

legible. The main purpose of interface text is to clearly communicate
information so that people can achieve a task. If a typeface isn‚Äôt legible, it
makes the interface harder to read, understand, and use.
2. Neutrality
Sans serif typefaces generally don‚Äôt convey a strong mood or personality.
This can be helpful for the following reasons 
The typeface will fit with most brand personalities.

---

## Chunk 748

The content is the focal point, rather than the typeface. 
There‚Äôs less chance you‚Äôll choose an unsuitable typeface.
3. Simplicity
Sans serif typefaces are generally simpler than others as they have less
character and detail. Complicated typefaces can be distracting and can
increase cognitive load, especially if there‚Äôs more than one.

---

## Chunk 749

Simplifying your typography can help improve usability and aesthetics. Less
is more when it comes to typography.

---

## Chunk 750

--- Page 235 ---
Typography 235
In the following example, multiple typefaces make the interface look complex
and cluttered. Some text is also difficult to read at a small size. Using a single
sans serif typeface, like Inter, removes complexity. This helps decrease
cognitive load, improve legibility, and it looks a lot neater too.

With so many typefaces to choose from, it can be difficult to know where to

Look for typefaces that come in a variety of weights, as they‚Äôre generally
better quality. Those with light, regular, medium, semibold, and bold
weights are a good place to start 
Look for typefaces with taller lower case letters and greater letter
spacing, as they‚Äôre generally more legible at small sizes. The height of
lowercase letters in a typeface is known as the x-height

## Chunk 756

Get inspiration from designers and companies known for good design.
Inspect their website code or check their brand guidelines for their

If your interface needs to support multiple languages, make sure the
typeface does too. 
Look for typefaces with OpenType features. They support both Mac and
Windows computers, usually offer better language support, and often

Use regular and bold font weights only
Just because there are lots of font weights available in a typeface, doesn‚Äôt
mean you need to use all of them in your designs. Using lots of different font
weights can add noise and clutter to your interface. It also makes it more
difficult to use each font weight consistently.

---

## Chunk 765

Keep your design system simple and concise by using regular and bold font
weights only. Some typefaces have a semi-bold font option that you can use
instead of bold if bold is too heavy. Quick usage tips: 
Use bold font weight for headings to emphasise them. 
Use regular font weight for other smaller text. 
Reserve very thin or thick font weights for headings and larger text, as

Using only regular and bold weights simplifies the design, making it look
neater and easier to understand. It also speeds up the design process, as
there are fewer decisions to make regarding typography.

Use a type scale to set font sizes
Using a type scale is a simple and logical way to create a set of balanced
font sizes that work well together. It‚Äôs best to have a limited set of font sizes
in your design system. It helps speed up decision making and improve
consistency across your product.

---

## Chunk 772

To create your set of font sizes, start with a base font size for body text, then
keep multiplying it by a certain scale to create larger font sizes.
Here are some popular type scales, ordered from smallest to largest

For example, start with a base font size of 16px and use a ‚Äú1.200 - Minor

Typography 243
Small type scales
Using a small type scale, like ‚ÄúMajor Second‚Äù, will result in less of a difference
between font sizes than using a large type scale. Small type scales are
generally more suitable for complex website applications, tools, and
dashboards where more detail is needed.
Large type scales

## Chunk 778

Using a large type scale, like ‚ÄúPerfect Fifth‚Äù, will result in a larger difference
between font sizes. Large type scales are generally more suitable for less
complex interfaces, like marketing websites.
Responsive type scales
While large type scales can work well on large screens, they can cause text
to wrap onto the next line on smaller mobile screens. To fix this issue, you

---

## Chunk 779

could consider switching to a smaller type scale on mobile.

## Chunk 780

Remember not to create text styles if you don‚Äôt need them. Every detail of

Make long body text bigger
Do you often find yourself zooming in on website articles to make the text
bigger so it‚Äôs easier to read? You‚Äôre not alone. Most websites have relatively
small text, especially older ones. Designers also tend to prefer small text, as
it generally looks nicer.

---

## Chunk 782

Most people will be reading text from around an arm‚Äôs length away, whether
it‚Äôs on a phone, tablet or desktop. So, make sure your body text is legible
from that distance. For most typefaces, make long body text at least 18px to
help improve readability.

Decrease line height as font size increases
The purpose of the spacing between lines is to help people read from one

well for body text, it‚Äôs unnecessary on larger sized text such as headings. The
larger the font size, the smaller the line height should be, to maintain

comfortable spacing.

---

## Chunk 794

In the following example, the line height of both the heading and paragraph
text is 1.6 (160%). Because line height is relative to font size, the actual space
between lines of heading text is much larger than the space between lines of
paragraph text. Decrease the line height for larger text to create a consistent
gap between lines.

Ensure ideal line length
Ensure text is 40 - 80 characters per line (including spaces) to improve
readability. If lines are too long, it makes it harder for people to gauge where
the line starts and ends.
If lines are too short, your eyes get stressed from having to travel back too
often. A comfortable line length is especially important for long body text.

Typography 251
Left align text
English is read from left to right, downwards in an F-shaped pattern. So it‚Äôs
best to keep text left aligned for optimal readability. For long body text, it‚Äôs
safest to avoid centre aligned or justified text. It‚Äôs more difficult to read,
especially for those with cognitive disabilities.

---

## Chunk 806

Also, avoid combinations of different text alignments. It‚Äôs harder for your eyes
to follow and can look messy.
Don‚Äôt centre align long body text
Centre alignment can work for headings and short text, as it can be quickly
read. However, centre alignment makes longer body text harder to read,
because the starting point of each line changes. Your eyes need to work

Don‚Äôt justify long body text
Books often justify text for aesthetics, ironically making them harder to read.
The variations in letter and word spacing make it harder for your eyes to
distinguish text and follow lines (especially for those with cognitive
impairments like dyslexia).
The variations in spacing also create distracting ‚Äúrivers‚Äù of white space,

Decrease letter spacing for large text
A small trick to make large headings look better is to decrease their letter
spacing (space between letters). How much you decrease letter spacing
depends on the typeface and size, but generally, you‚Äôll want to decrease
letter spacing more as text gets bigger.

---

## Chunk 815

This is because many typefaces were designed to be read at small sizes in
long body text. They‚Äôre known as ‚Äútext type‚Äù typefaces and have wide letter
spacing to make them more legible at small sizes. You probably won‚Äôt need to
decrease letter spacing for ‚Äúdisplay type‚Äù typefaces, as they were designed
to be used at large sizes and generally have closer letter spacing.

Ensure text on photos is legible
Placing text directly on photos is a very common design mistake. Depending
on the photo, this can make text illegible, especially to people with low vision.
Ensure the contrast ratio of text placed on photos meets WCAG 2.1 level AA
accessibility requirements:

---

## Chunk 819

Small text (18px and under) should have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 
Large text (above 18px with bold weight or above 24px with regular
weight) should have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.

## Chunk 820

In the following example, white text is placed directly on the photo making it

Add a linear gradient overlay
In the following example, a linear gradient overlay is placed behind text to
achieve sufficient contrast. The gradient starts with a dark grey colour at
90% opacity at the bottom of the photo and ends with 0% opacity halfway up
the photo. A text shadow further increases the text contrast.

Avoid light grey and pure black text
Designers tend to be drawn to light grey text, as it can look soft and minimal.
However, this poses an accessibility issue, as many people either can‚Äôt read it
or find it difficult to do so. Always aim for text to have at least a 4.5:1 contrast
ratio to meet WCAG 2.1 level AA accessibility requirements.

---

## Chunk 827

Avoid very light grey text Use accessible grey text

---

## Chunk 828

You also need to avoid contrast that‚Äôs too high, as it can cause eye strain and
fatigue. Black has 0% colour brightness and white has 100% colour
brightness. The large difference in colour brightness causes our eyes to work
harder. So it‚Äôs safest to avoid pure black text on a white background and opt
for an accessible dark grey instead.

Be concise
Every element of your interface should earn its place, especially the words.
Ironically, more words don‚Äôt necessarily result in more effective
communication, as people often won‚Äôt read large chunks of text.

---

## Chunk 865

Our attention spans are shorter than ever, so aim to say more, with fewer
words. If a word can be removed without losing information or negatively
affecting usability, remove it. Being concise makes your content faster and
easier to understand.

Example of unnecessary text versus concise text

---

## Chunk 868

Copywriting 268
Some guidelines on how to be concise 
Avoid unneeded words like: ‚Äúactually‚Äù, ‚Äúbasically‚Äù, ‚Äúreally‚Äù, ‚Äútruthfully‚Äù,
and ‚Äúquite‚Äù. 
Avoid short joining words like: ‚Äúa‚Äù, ‚Äúan‚Äù, and ‚Äúthe‚Äù. 
Avoid introductory phrases like: ‚Äúwould you like to‚Äù, ‚Äúin order to‚Äù, ‚Äúwhen it
comes to‚Äù, ‚Äúare you sure‚Äù, "there are" and "it is".

---

## Chunk 869

Use shorter words instead of longer ones if they convey the same
message. 
Try to keep sentences under 20 words. People can lose focus when
reading long sentences with a lot of commas.

---

## Chunk 870

--- Page 269 ---
Copywriting 269
Use sentence case
Sentence case is where only the first word and proper nouns (names of
people, places or things) are capitalised. For example, ‚ÄúThis is sentence
case‚Äù. It‚Äôs super simple, easy to read, and grammatically correct.

---

## Chunk 871

Another popular capitalisation style is title case. All words are capitalised
except for minor words, unless they‚Äôre the first or last word of the title. For
example, ‚ÄúThis Is Title Case‚Äù.

---

## Chunk 872

Title case is commonly used for book and article titles, but it‚Äôs often misused
as its complex rules aren‚Äôt universally standardised. Title case is also harder
to read, as the capital letters of each word interrupt scanning. Our minds are
expecting a lower case letter, so an uppercase letter confuses us. This
unnecessarily increases cognitive load.

## Chunk 875

Avoid jargon (specialised or technical language that‚Äôs only understood by
particular groups of people) 
Avoid slang (very informal language used between people in the same

Front-load text
Front-loading is putting the important information at the start of your text.
People quickly scan text down the page from left to right. Putting the key
information or benefit at the front of your headings, lists, and links makes it
faster and easier for people to gain value from your text.

The inverted pyramid is a writing structure where the most important

then smaller background details. It‚Äôs a similar concept to front-loading text
but it applies to larger pieces of text.

Limit the use of abbreviations and acronyms
An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. For example, the
word ‚Äúdepartment‚Äù can be abbreviated to ‚Äúdept.‚Äù to shorten it. An acronym is
a common type of abbreviation formed from the initial letters of words. For
example, ‚ÄúCOB‚Äù stands for ‚Äúclose of business‚Äù.

---

## Chunk 886

Abbreviations can save space, but they make people think, which increases
cognitive load. Limit the use of abbreviations to improve readability and
reduce confusion. If you do use them, explain what they are initially.

---

## Chunk 887

‚ÄúThe ETA of the dept. manager is COB tomorrow‚Äù, could be unclear to some
people. Instead, explain the acronyms when they‚Äôre first used, to make it

(close of business) tomorrow‚Äù.

Limit the use of UPPERCASE
Unless you‚Äôre shouting at people, there aren‚Äôt many valid reasons to use
uppercase. IT‚ÄôS LOUD AND DIFFICULT TO READ. When you read, you look at
the shape of a word, rather than looking at each letter. The shape helps you
recognise the word more quickly. Uppercase words all have the same

rectangular shape. This forces you to read each letter one by one.
SHAPE Shape
That being said, you can use uppercase for short labels to help visually
differentiate them from other text. Use uppercase in bold weight at a small
size and increase the letter spacing. This makes it less loud and more legible.

Avoid using ‚Äúmy‚Äù on form labels
Avoid using the word ‚Äúmy‚Äù on form labels as it can be confusing. Think of the
interface as a person who‚Äôs talking to the user. An input field labelled ‚Äúmy

## Chunk 911

For very large numbers, consider simplifying them by using a combination of
numerals and letters. For example, write 1 billion, not 1,000,000,000. This
avoids people having to count how many numbers there are, and decreases
cognitive load.

Avoid full stops if possible
Most user interface text should be short enough that commas and full stops
(periods) aren‚Äôt needed. Don‚Äôt add full stops unless the piece of text forms a
full sentence with commas.
Full stops are a tiny detail, but removing them when they‚Äôre not needed can
help simplify your interface design.

---

## Chunk 913

If you have multiple similar interface elements next to each other, make sure
you use full stops consistently across them.
In the following example, full stops are used inconsistently. Since there aren‚Äôt
any commas used, it‚Äôs neater to avoid using full stops.

Ensure text links describe their destination
The purpose of a text link is to take you to another page or a different part of
the same page. Text links need to describe where they‚Äôll take you when
actioned. Using generic text like ‚Äúlearn more‚Äù, ‚Äúread more‚Äù, or ‚Äúclick here‚Äù for
text links can be problematic for the following reasons:

It‚Äôs more difficult to scan a page with links that aren‚Äôt descriptive, as

Learn how to design descriptive and accessible

## Chunk 955

--- Page 296 ---
Buttons 296
Define 3 button weights
In most cases, you‚Äôll need 3 button weights to indicate the importance of
actions: primary, secondary, and tertiary. You may also require smaller and/or
larger button sizes depending on the complexity of the interface.

---

## Chunk 956

The following button styles are familiar, accessible, and have a clear visual
hierarchy that isn‚Äôt dependent on colour alone. They‚Äôre not the only way to
style buttons, but they‚Äôre a safe option.
Primary Secondary Tertiary
Primary button - a rectangle with rounded corners, a solid fill of the
brand colour, and white text. This is the most prominent button used to

---

## Chunk 957

highlight the most important action 
Secondary button - an unfilled rectangle with a border and rounded
corners. Use the brand colour for the text and border for consistency with
other interactive elements. Avoid using a solid fill of another colour, as it
could conflict with the primary button. It‚Äôs also safest to avoid using a light

---

## Chunk 958

grey fill or outline, as it could be mistaken for a disabled button (a button
that‚Äôs unavailable and can‚Äôt be pressed) 
Tertiary button - a transparent button with underlined text that looks like
a text link. Use the brand colour for consistency with other interactive
elements. Underline the text to ensure people who are colour blind can
tell that it‚Äôs interactive.

Buttons 297
Common button design mistakes
Let‚Äôs look at the issues with some popular button designs. These issues pose
a potential risk to usability, so it‚Äôs safest to avoid them if possible. We‚Äôll aim to
at least meet WCAG 2.1 level AA accessibility guidelines, as this is the most
common standard and a good place to start.

---

## Chunk 960

The following 9 button examples are problematic and should be avoided.‚Ä®
Example 1
Primary Secondary Tertiary
User interface components like form fields, buttons, and tabs, need to have a
colour contrast ratio of at least 3:1. This helps people with low vision tell the
difference between different components. Decorative styles that aren‚Äôt

---

## Chunk 961

required to distinguish interface components can have lower contrast.

---

## Chunk 962

In this example, the secondary button fill contrast ratio against the
background is less than 3:1. This is too low to clearly indicate the button
shape to those with low vision.
Some designers may argue that the secondary button fill is decorative and
doesn‚Äôt need to have a contrast ratio of 3:1 to be accessible. The fill is

---

## Chunk 963

needed to identify the secondary button as a button. Without the fill, it‚Äôs just
plain blue text with no indicator of interactivity but colour. You could add a
high contrast border to the secondary button to fix this issue.

---

## Chunk 964

--- Page 298 ---
Buttons 298
Example 2
Primary Secondary Tertiary
The button styles in example 2 have the following issues 
The secondary button could be mistaken as being unavailable or in a
disabled state due to its light grey colour. It‚Äôs safest to avoid light grey
buttons to reduce potential confusion 
The secondary button text contrast ratio is less than the required 4.5:1

---

## Chunk 965

WCAG guideline, making it difficult to read for some 
The secondary button border is also less than the required 3:1 ratio.
Example 3
Primary Secondary Tertiary
The button styles in example 3 have the following issues 
The primary and secondary buttons conflict due to their similarity. This
confuses the visual hierarchy, making it unclear which is more important

---

## Chunk 966

Since both buttons have the same style, the only way to tell the
difference between them is via their colour. This means people who are
colour blind may not be able to differentiate between them 
The contrast ratio between the buttons is also less than the required 3:1.
This means that people with low vision may not be able to clearly
distinguish between them.

---

## Chunk 967

--- Page 299 ---
Buttons 299
Example 4
Primary Secondary Tertiary
The button styles in example 4 have similar issues to the previous example 
The primary and secondary buttons conflict due to their similar style and
lack of contrast 
The secondary button text contrast ratio is too low and should be at least
4.5:1 to ensure it‚Äôs accessible.
Example 5
Primary Secondary Tertiary

---

## Chunk 968

The button styles in example 5 are too similar for people with low vision to
distinguish between. The contrast ratio between buttons is the only way to
tell the difference between them and it‚Äôs less than the required 3:1 ratio.
Buttons should have a clear visual hierarchy that isn‚Äôt reliant on colour.

---

## Chunk 969

--- Page 300 ---
Buttons 300
Example 6
Primary Secondary Tertiary
The button styles in example 6 have similar issues to the previous example 
Button styles are too similar in contrast and style for those with low vision
to differentiate 
The contrast ratio of the tertiary button border must be at least 3:1 to be
accessible and clearly identify it as an interactive element.
Example 7

---

## Chunk 970

Primary Secondary Tertiary
When it comes to accessibility, it‚Äôs important that we don‚Äôt rely on colour
alone to distinguish interface elements. Those who are colour blind won‚Äôt be
able to tell the difference between elements.

---

## Chunk 971

In example 7, the tertiary button isn‚Äôt accessible because colour is the only
indicator that it‚Äôs interactive. This means that those who are colour blind may
not be able to distinguish it from plain text.

The context, position and close proximity of the tertiary button to other
buttons may help distinguish it from plain text in some cases, but there‚Äôs still
a risk that it could cause confusion.

---

## Chunk 972

--- Page 301 ---
Buttons 301
Example 8
Primary Secondary Tertiary
Every detail of an interface design should have a logical purpose. Why are
the primary and secondary button shapes different in example 8? Do they
function differently? Elements that function the same should look the same.
Avoid inconsistent button shapes as they can cause confusion.
Example 9
Primary Secondary Tertiary

---

## Chunk 973

Visual hierarchy is how we communicate the relative importance of interface
elements. The purpose of the 3 button styles is to indicate the importance of
actions. This helps people make decisions. The button styles in example 9
have the following issues 
The visual hierarchy is unclear, as the primary and secondary buttons
have similar visual weight or prominence

---

## Chunk 974

The secondary button background contrast ratio is below 3:1, which is too
low to clearly indicate the button shape to people with low vision.

Button design guidelines
Based on the previous button design mistakes, here are some quick and
practical tips to keep in mind to design user-friendly and accessible buttons

colour alone 
The contrast ratio of the button shape must be at least 3:1 to ensure

---

## Chunk 976

people with low vision can identify it as an interactive element 
The button text contrast ratio must be at least 4.5:1 to meet WCAG 2.1
level AA accessibility requirements 
If buttons have identical styles, the contrast ratio between them must be
at least 3:1 to ensure they‚Äôre distinguishable to those with low vision 
Use a large target area (at least 48pt by 48pt) to ensure people can easily

Make sure there‚Äôs sufficient space between buttons so people don‚Äôt
mistakenly press the wrong one. I usually use 16pt to be safe.

---

## Chunk 978

--- Page 303 ---
Buttons 303
Use a single primary button for the most
important action
The purpose of a primary button is to highlight the most important action on
an interface. This helps people understand what to do next in order to
complete their task.
Guidelines for using primary buttons 
If there isn‚Äôt a single most important action on an interface, use secondary

---

## Chunk 979

or tertiary buttons for those actions. 
Avoid using multiple primary buttons on a screen. They can compete for
attention and cause confusion around what to do next.

Buttons 304
In the following example, multiple primary buttons are competing for
attention. This is telling people that all of these actions are the most
important action on the screen. Multiple primary buttons can clutter an
interface and confuse the visual hierarchy. If everything is considered
important, then nothing stands out as the most important.

---

## Chunk 982

Using less prominent secondary buttons instead helps to correct the visual
hierarchy. You could also use tertiary buttons to further decrease the
prominence of the buttons.

Use secondary buttons for less
important actions
Secondary buttons are usually the alternative to the primary action. Use
secondary buttons for less important actions or for multiple actions that have
equal importance.
The following example is a message that appears after someone deletes a
suspicious email from their inbox. It‚Äôs up to them whether they want to report

---

## Chunk 985

the email as junk or not. Since the buttons have equal importance, they
should have equal prominence. Don‚Äôt make one button more prominent than
the other as it creates bias.

Use tertiary buttons for the least
important actions
Due to their low prominence, tertiary buttons are especially good for
displaying multiple actions or destructive actions that you want to make
less prominent.

---

## Chunk 988

In the following example, too much attention is brought to destructive
actions. This causes them to compete with the primary ‚Äúsend invite‚Äù action.
Using tertiary buttons instead reduces their prominence. This corrects the
visual hierarchy, clearly making ‚Äúsend invite‚Äù the most prominent action.

Try to avoid disabled buttons
A disabled button can‚Äôt be actioned. It‚Äôs often a very low contrast colour and
is used to prevent people from taking actions that aren‚Äôt available or could
cause an error.

reasons mentioned previously. Instead of disabling the submit button, enable
it and display error messages on submit.

## Chunk 995

In the following example, the user mistakenly missed the first field and is

Remove unavailable actions
Rather than disabling actions that aren't available, consider removing them
and letting people know why they‚Äôre unavailable.

In the following example, some actions are disabled. They‚Äôre unavailable until
the person accepts your request to follow them. Some people could be
confused as to why the buttons can‚Äôt be pressed.

Ensure button text describes the action
Button text should clearly describe the action being taken so that it‚Äôs
meaningful when read out of context. A simple rule for button text that works
well in most cases, is a verb (action) followed by a noun (thing).
For example, ‚ÄúSave post‚Äù, ‚ÄúDiscard message‚Äù, and ‚ÄúEdit article‚Äù. Button text

---

## Chunk 1023

should be descriptive for the following reasons: 
Some people will look at buttons first, as they‚Äôre very prominent.
Descriptive button text allows them to take action quickly, without having
to read supporting text 
Screen reader users often jump straight to buttons and links on a page, so
button text needs to make sense when read out of context.

Ensure buttons have a sufficient target size
Small targets are more difficult to click or touch than large ones. This is
especially true for those with impaired motor control, or even someone
holding their phone with one hand and using their thumb.
Try to stick to the following guidelines to ensure buttons (and other

interactive elements) have a sufficient target size 
Make buttons at least 48pt by 48pt in size. This aligns with an 8pt grid
and is slightly larger than the WCAG recommendation of 44pt by 44pt. 
Make frequently used buttons even larger to improve efficiency and to
help avoid them being missed 
Separate buttons by at least 8pt to help prevent people mistakenly
pressing the wrong one.

---

## Chunk 1027

In the following example, the up and down arrows in the stepper component

In the example below, the icons are larger and thicker than the text they‚Äôre

Add friction to destructive actions
A destructive action is one that causes harm or can‚Äôt be undone, like
permanently deleting important information. Adding friction involves
increasing the interaction cost required to perform an action. To help prevent
people from mistakenly performing destructive actions, introduce increasing

---

## Chunk 1037

amounts of friction based on the severity of the action.

---

## Chunk 1038

Let‚Äôs go through the different levels of friction.
Initial friction
Before a destructive action is taken, introduce friction to help prevent people
from mistakenly actioning it. This generally involves making the action less
prominent, moving it further away, or progressively disclosing it. Don‚Äôt colour
the action red, as this makes it more prominent.

Stack forms in a single column layout
Form fields are often arranged in multiple columns to save space. A single
column form layout is the safest, most efficient, and simplest form layout for
the following reasons 
It‚Äôs more efficient to complete, as it decreases interaction cost by
maintaining a consistent downward momentum

---

## Chunk 1060

It decreases cognitive load, as people don‚Äôt need to think about what field
to fill out next. They simply move down the page in a straight line 
Since there‚Äôs only a single downward path to fill out the form, there‚Äôs less
chance of people missing fields. Those using screen magnifiers have a
limited view of the screen and could miss fields in a second column.

## Chunk 1068

To avoid the issues previously mentioned, stack labels closely on top of
inputs. It‚Äôs neat and tidy, maintains a simple and consistent downward
momentum, and decreases interaction cost. This is because your eyes can

The main downside of stacking form elements in a single column is that it
takes up more vertical space. While this can make forms feel longer and may
deter some people from filling them out, the advantages of a single column
form layout far outweigh the disadvantages.

---

## Chunk 1071

To reduce the height of forms, short related fields can be placed side by
side. For example, it‚Äôs common for the credit card expiry date and CVC
number to be placed side by side.
Since the fields are relatively small, they‚Äôre contained within the bounds of
the single column layout. This means they avoid most of the issues that
come with a multi-column form layout.

If a form is getting very long and it‚Äôs affecting completion rates, consider
breaking it up into multiple smaller steps. This can help decrease cognitive

Minimise the number of form fields
People generally don‚Äôt want to give away their personal information. Only ask
for information that‚Äôs essential to providing your product or service.
More form fields can be problematic and can result in: 
A higher chance that some won‚Äôt complete the form 
More work for those completing the form

Required form fields must be completed before a form can be submitted
successfully. Optional fields don‚Äôt need to be completed.
Ideally, you should only ask people for essential information, but sometimes
optional fields can‚Äôt be avoided. They can also be helpful to gather extra
information from people to improve their experience.

Try to avoid optional fields by using opt-ins
Including optional fields on forms adds complexity. To simplify forms, try to
avoid optional fields altogether. Ask people to opt-in to provide non-essential
information.

---

## Chunk 1080

For example, let‚Äôs say that you have a form with an optional mobile phone
number input field. It‚Äôs for people looking to receive updates via text
message. Instead of using an optional field, ask people whether they‚Äôd like to
receive updates first (using a checkbox). If they would, then ask for their
mobile number (using a required input field).

The problem with leaving required fields unmarked
Marking required fields with an asterisk * or the word ‚Äúrequired‚Äù is often
avoided by designers to reduce clutter. Instead, only optional fields are
marked and the following instructions are included at the top of the form:
‚ÄúAll fields are required unless marked optional‚Äù.

Mark required fields with an asterisk *
Marking required fields with an asterisk is a concise and familiar way to
clearly indicate the fields people need to complete. Avoid colouring the
asterisks red, as red commonly indicates an error.

You still need to include instructions at the top of the form, but it won‚Äôt

Match field width to the intended input
The width of a form field sets people‚Äôs expectations for the amount of
information expected in the field. Using a wide field to collect a small piece of
information can increase cognitive load and cause confusion.
Even though it looks neat and tidy, don‚Äôt set all fields to the same width. The

Stick with conventional form field styles
According to Jakob‚Äôs Law, it‚Äôs safest to use conventional design patterns that
people are familiar with. Aligning to people‚Äôs existing mental models
(understanding of how something works) can help avoid usability issues and
decrease cognitive load. So, stick with conventional form field styles.

---

## Chunk 1104

In the following example, unconventional form field styles make it unclear
where people should put the answer to each question. Because the labels
are inside the fields where the answers go, the fields already look filled. This
makes it harder to distinguish between filled and empty fields. Using
conventional field styles makes it much clearer.

If you‚Äôre keen to modify form fields, try to ensure that they still contain the

The radio buttons, in the following example, were modified to increase their

behaviour is unclear. Can multiple items be selected? Do they link

them to conventional radio buttons. This lets people know that one option

Display hints above form fields
Sometimes a short label isn‚Äôt enough to clearly describe the information
required in a form field. A ‚Äúhint‚Äù or "helper text‚Äù is additional information that
helps people complete a form field.

---

## Chunk 1110

To help declutter an interface, hints are often hidden in tooltips (floating
messages displayed on hover or press of an action). There‚Äôs a risk that
hidden hint text could be missed. If additional information is critical to help
people complete a field, ensure it‚Äôs visible.

---

## Chunk 1111

Hints are often placed below form fields, but it‚Äôs more logical to place them
above fields. This helps people avoid errors and maintain downward
momentum when completing forms. If a password needs to be at least 6
characters long, tell people before they fill out the password field, not after.

of a label, as seen in the following example.

Placeholder text being used as a label versus an input with a separate label on top

## Chunk 1116

This is problematic for the following reasons: 
Placeholder text disappears once a person starts filling in an input field,

Some might miss or skip fields with placeholder text, as it can look like the
field has already been pre-filled.

Ensure form field labels are close to
their fields
It‚Äôs very common for form field labels to be spaced relatively far away from
their input fields. This makes it unclear which labels relate to which fields.
When spacing interface elements, make sure that related elements are
spaced closer together to clearly indicate that they‚Äôre related.

An autocomplete search field displays suggestions as someone types into

Ensure form field borders are high contrast
Low contrast form fields are one of the most common UI design mistakes.
Light borders on form fields can look nice, but there‚Äôs a risk that some people
may have difficulty seeing the borders. It could be someone with low vision
or even a sighted user viewing the interface outside on a sunny day.

---

## Chunk 1155

Borders are a distinctive detail that differentiate form fields from other
interface elements. Without borders, it‚Äôs unclear how to interact with a form
field. Make sure the contrast ratio of form field borders is at least 3:1. This
rule applies to any interface element to ensure it‚Äôs accessible: buttons, toggle
switches, inputs, steppers, checkboxes, and radio buttons.

---

## Chunk 1156

If you‚Äôre low on time and development resources, keep it simple and validate
the form once a person submits it. It may sound simplistic, but it‚Äôs the way
forms were originally designed and it‚Äôs still a valid approach.

Quick guidelines for validating forms on submit 
Display a prominent error message above invalid form fields (rather than
below) to help ensure errors are always visible. The space below form
fields can be covered by autofill menus and on-screen keyboards 
Use a red border and background shade to prominently highlight invalid

fields. Make sure you also include an icon for people who are colour blind.
Never rely on colour alone to distinguish interface elements. 
If there are multiple errors, let people know how many there are and list
them at the top of the form. Make the listed errors links that take people
to the corresponding invalid field 
Don‚Äôt disable the submit button, as disabled buttons can be problematic.

Advantages
Relatively simple and easy to implement 
Allows people to focus on form completion without distractions.
Disadvantages
As people are completing a form, they have no idea whether they‚Äôre
answering questions correctly or not. 
People could be overwhelmed and frustrated by facing multiple errors all
at once 
People are forced to navigate through the entire form again to find and fix

errors when they may have lost context 
It doesn't work when people need assistance promptly, such as when
someone requires help creating a password that meets specific criteria.

2. Validate after people leave a field
Rather than informing people of errors after they‚Äôve completed a form, this
approach lets them know if they‚Äôve made a mistake immediately after they‚Äôve
completed a field. Validating after people leave a field is commonly known as
inline validation or validating ‚Äúon blur‚Äù.

---

## Chunk 1168

Remove the error message once the error has been resolved to let people
know they've fixed it. This involves using the third validation approach
(validating instantly as people type).

Email is validated once a person leaves the field
Advantages
People receive immediate feedback, so they're not left wondering

## Chunk 1169

whether they‚Äôre answering questions correctly or not 
People can fix errors faster while they still have context 
It can be used to provide positive feedback for correct inputs, such as
confirming that a password meets certain criteria.
Disadvantages
People could be distracted by the need to repeatedly switch between
answering questions and fixing errors

It doesn‚Äôt work well for groups of inputs, such as a list of checkboxes 
It can be relatively complex to implement.

3. Validate instantly as people type
This approach waits until people have stopped typing their answer before
validating it. To help prevent premature error messages, a delay is typically
introduced once they‚Äôve stopped typing.
Password
Password must be at least 8 characters

Password is validated as a person types
Advantages

## Chunk 1172

It helps people work toward an answer. For example, creating a password
that needs to meet certain criteria or checking if a username is available 
People receive immediate feedback, so they're not left wondering
whether they‚Äôre answering questions correctly or not 
People can fix errors faster while they still have context.
Disadvantages

---

## Chunk 1173

Premature error messages can frustrate people and hinder form
completion. Since people type at different speeds, it‚Äôs difficult to know
when they‚Äôve finished typing their answer 
It can be relatively complex to implement.

Chapter summary
Stack forms in a single column layout, as it decreases interaction cost
by maintaining a consistent downward momentum.
Mark both required and optional fields to avoid people guessing
whether form fields are required or not.
Match field width to the intended input, as the width sets people‚Äôs

expectations for the amount of information expected in the field.
Rather than using dropdowns, consider using radio buttons,
autocomplete search fields, or steppers, depending on the use case.
Break up long forms into multiple smaller steps to decrease cognitive
load, reduce mistakes, and improve completion rates.

Closing thoughts
Congratulations on levelling up your design skills. I hope you feel a lot more
confident about designing intuitive, accessible, and beautiful interfaces.
My goal when writing this book was to equip you with a system of logical
guidelines to help you make informed design decisions efficiently. Guidelines

---

## Chunk 1178

can seem restrictive, but they‚Äôre not meant to limit your creativity. Instead,
think of them as a solid foundation to build, explore, and experiment on.
After seeing the how and why behind each guideline, I think you‚Äôll agree that
UI design is about much more than just making an interface look pretty.
Here‚Äôs a quick recap of some of the key guidelines

---

## Chunk 1179

Minimise usability risk by keeping interfaces simple and familiar 
Don‚Äôt just make design decisions based on what looks pretty, ensure that
every interface detail has a logical reason behind it 
Minimise interaction cost and cognitive load as much as possible 
Create a design system of predefined styles, modular components, and
usage guidelines to help you make consistent design decisions faster

---

## Chunk 1180

Good accessibility means great usability, so design interfaces for
everyone to use.

---

## Chunk 1181

I hope this logic-driven approach to UI design will serve you as well in your
career as it has in mine.

Please review the book
If you found the book helpful, please take a few seconds to review it. I‚Äôve
spent literally thousands of hours working on every detail and I‚Äôd really
appreciate your support. It will help me continue to make further
improvements and grow the book.

Got feedback?
I don‚Äôt claim to know it all. In fact, it‚Äôs quite the opposite. The more I learn, the
more I realise how much I have yet to learn. I‚Äôm always open to hearing
different ideas or having my ideas constructively challenged. That‚Äôs how we
learn and grow as designers.
